MISTER QU@@ IL@@ TER IS THE APO@@ STLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GO@@ SPE@@ L
NOR IS MISTER QU@@ IL@@ TER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTI@@ VE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND RO@@ AST BE@@ EF LOO@@ MING BEFORE US SI@@ MILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LE@@ IGH@@ TON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY I@@ TH@@ AC@@ A

IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LU@@ MIN@@ OUS THESE CRITIC@@ IS@@ MS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QU@@ IL@@ TER WRITES WITH EQUAL LU@@ CI@@ DITY
PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MA@@ THEM@@ ATI@@ CS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FACT
AS FOR E@@ TCH@@ INGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
HE LA@@ MENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIV@@ OR@@ CE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECOR@@ ATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES THE CUSTO@@ MARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND RE@@ MINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHA@@ EL ANG@@ EL@@ O WAS THE FURN@@ ISHING UP@@ HOL@@ STER@@ ER
NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAM@@ ENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MAN@@ TEL BOARD
IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RU@@ SKIN FOR NOT RECOGN@@ ISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DEN@@ OTE THE FRA@@ IL@@ TY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FELIC@@ ITOUS GRACE THAT MANY PHA@@ SES OF FEELING
ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOOD
MISTER QU@@ IL@@ TER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TU@@ PPER OF PAINTING
BY HARRY QU@@ IL@@ TER M A
BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQU@@ ERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FI@@ DDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHA@@ GGY S@@ ITS THERE A COO@@ ING DO@@ VE
HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED PO@@ LY@@ CH@@ ROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEE@@ ZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCUR@@ REN@@ CES WITH MUCH INTEREST
I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THRE@@ ADS
THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RA@@ PS AND OPENED THE DOOR
THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
I BEGGED RU@@ G@@ GE@@ DO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO
HE E@@ ATS AND SLE@@ EPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHA@@ GGY
HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL
IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DO@@ MINI@@ ONS AS WELL AS OUR NO@@ MES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WOR@@ RIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
NOT EXACTLY RETURNED K@@ ALI@@ KO
WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW
INQUIRED SHA@@ GGY IN THE METAL FOREST
WHERE IS THAT
THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DO@@ MED CA@@ VER@@ N THE LAR@@ GEST IN ALL OUR DO@@ MINI@@ ONS REPLIED K@@ ALI@@ KO
K@@ ALI@@ KO HESITATED
HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T
THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BET@@ SY THOUGHTFULLY
I DON'T BELIEVE AN@@ N KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE
I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHA@@ GGY
TRUE AGREED K@@ ALI@@ KO
K@@ ALI@@ KO WENT TO THE BIG G@@ ONG AND P@@ OUNDED ON IT JUST AS RU@@ G@@ GE@@ DO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMM@@ ONS
HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CA@@ VER@@ N K@@ ALI@@ KO FIRST P@@ OUNDED THE G@@ ONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RU@@ G@@ GE@@ DO@@ 'S DIS@@ CAR@@ DED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE S@@ CEP@@ TR@@ E WHICH RU@@ G@@ GE@@ DO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST
SWE@@ AT COVERED BRI@@ ON'S BODY TRI@@ CKLING INTO THE TIGHT LO@@ IN@@ CLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GAR@@ MENT HE WORE
THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRI@@ PPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVER@@ STRAINED EYES EVEN THE SO@@ ARING A@@ REN@@ A AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRI@@ VI@@ ALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BU@@ ZZ@@ ER SOUNDED
A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FR@@ ACTION OF IT
THE BU@@ ZZ@@ ER'S WHIR@@ R TRI@@ GG@@ ERED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELA@@ X@@ ATION
ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEAS@@ URED RATE
HE WAS IN REVER@@ I@@ E SLI@@ DING ALONG THE BOR@@ DERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
THE CONTE@@ STAN@@ TS IN THE TWENTI@@ ES NEEDED UN@@ DISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DOR@@ MIT@@ ORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CU@@ BIC@@ LES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH UR@@ GEN@@ CY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRAN@@ D@@ D IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE
THE TWENTI@@ ES
HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRU@@ DER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL OUT
THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRI@@ ON WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
TEN SECONDS
HE ASKED THE HAND@@ LER WHO WAS KNE@@ ADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY IN@@ EXHAUSTI@@ BLE STORE OF ENERGY
THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FEN@@ CING
JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER
EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTI@@ ES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRI@@ CKS
THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH TRA@@ U@@ MA AS IF THE TWO WERE IN@@ EX@@ TRI@@ CA@@ BLY LIN@@ KED INTO ONE
THE STRENGTH THAT EN@@ ABLES SOMEONE IN A TRAN@@ CE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UN@@ SUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
THIS IS PHYSI@@ CALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS
OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTI@@ ES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
BREATHING DEEPLY BRI@@ ON SOFTLY SPOKE THE AU@@ TO HYPNOTIC PH@@ RAS@@ ES THAT TRI@@ GG@@ ERED THE PROCESS
WHEN THE BU@@ ZZ@@ ER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FO@@ IL FROM HIS SECON@@ D'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
I@@ ROL@@ G LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
BRI@@ ON SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPON@@ ENT@@ 'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM I@@ ROL@@ G BRI@@ ON SEN@@ SED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
THEN THE POWERFUL TWI@@ ST THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF CO@@ STU@@ ME A KEY TO SHA@@ KE@@ SPEA@@ RE'S SON@@ NETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ER@@ NEST DOW@@ SON ET CETERA
HU@@ GH@@ 'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE IN@@ EXPRES@@ SIBLE
I HAPPEN TO HAVE MA@@ C CON@@ N@@ ELL@@ 'S BOX FOR TON@@ IGHT OR THERE@@ 'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MIL@@ DLY
MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAIN@@ HALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HAN@@ SOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS G@@ LOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXAN@@ DER@@ 'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
OF COURSE HI@@ L@@ DA IS IRISH THE BUR@@ GO@@ YN@@ ES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GO@@ S@@ SO@@ ONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY R@@ INGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PRO@@ LONGED UPROAR
AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DI@@ ALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHI@@ LL@@ Y'S BUR@@ ROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WRE@@ ATH OF PRIM@@ ROSES FOR HER DON@@ KEY
MA@@ C CON@@ N@@ ELL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BAR@@ T@@ LEY ALEXANDER
THE PLAY@@ W@@ RIGHT GAVE MAIN@@ HALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A W@@ RY FACE
HE NODDED CUR@@ TLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DO@@ DGING ACQUAINT@@ ANCES AS HE WENT
I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
SIR HARRY TO@@ W@@ NE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TO@@ K@@ YO
I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FA@@ M@@ OUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEE@@ DY POOR CHILD
A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAIN@@ HALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WEST@@ MERE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUST@@ ACHE TALKING TO LADY DOW@@ LE
IN A MOMENT PE@@ GGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APP@@ LAU@@ DED VIGOR@@ OUSLY WITH THE REST
IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STAL@@ LS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RE@@ CALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HAR@@ RY'S JUDI@@ CIAL FRO@@ WN
HE LEANED FORWARD AND BE@@ AMED FELIC@@ ITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAIN@@ HALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CUR@@ TAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TRE@@ MUL@@ OUS WITH EXCITEMENT
ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HI@@ L@@ DA
I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PRO@@ X@@ IM@@ ITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BAR@@ T@@ LEY FOUND ALMOST IN@@ TOLERABLE
EMER@@ GING AT EU@@ STON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LU@@ GG@@ AGE SENT TO THE SA@@ VO@@ Y AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BED@@ FORD SQUARE
SHE BLU@@ SHED AND SMILED AND FU@@ MBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
A COAL FIRE WAS CRACK@@ LING IN THE GR@@ ATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEF@@ TLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
SHE MERELY BRU@@ SHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOY@@ OUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BAR@@ T@@ LEY
WHEN DID YOU COME BAR@@ T@@ LEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CAT@@ AP@@ ULT IN LE@@ ASH
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BAR@@ T@@ LEY SHE SAID TRE@@ MUL@@ OUSLY
HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
HI@@ L@@ DA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
IT'S UN@@ BEAR@@ ABLE IT TOR@@ TURES ME EVERY MINUTE
I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVER@@ ISHLY EACH LIFE SPO@@ ILS THE OTHER
I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
THERE IS THIS DE@@ CEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
AT THAT WORD DE@@ CEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HI@@ L@@ DA@@ 'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHI@@ PL@@ ASH
SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGH@@ TLY IN FRONT OF HER
COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BAR@@ T@@ LEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DE@@ FIED
HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
AFTER THE VERY FIRST
HI@@ L@@ DA@@ 'S FACE QUI@@ VERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WER@@ EN@@ 'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
SOMETHING OF THEIR TROU@@ B@@ LING SWEE@@ TNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
YES HI@@ L@@ DA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
I UNDERSTAND BAR@@ T@@ LEY I WAS WRONG
SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CRE@@ AKING OF HIS CHAIR
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
BAR@@ T@@ LEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HI@@ L@@ DA
OH BAR@@ T@@ LEY WHAT AM I TO DO
YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGIN@@ ABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
HI@@ L@@ DA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CAR@@ ING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
SHE SLI@@ D TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMP@@ LIC@@ ATIONS WHICH WERE DELA@@ YING ALEXAN@@ DER@@ 'S NEW JER@@ SEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
OVER THE FIRE@@ PLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GIL@@ T MIRROR
HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
OF COURSE I KNOW BAR@@ T@@ LEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE O@@ O@@ ZING WATER
IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPH@@ ONED ME OR ANYTHING
I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
OH BAR@@ T@@ LEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
YES I KNOW VERY WELL
ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGH@@ TEN ME
A LAU@@ D@@ ABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOR OF THE FIRST PRO@@ SEL@@ Y@@ TE HAS COUNTEN@@ ANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE E@@ BI@@ ON@@ ITES OR AT LEAST THE NA@@ ZA@@ REN@@ ES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PER@@ SEVER@@ ANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MO@@ SA@@ IC RIT@@ ES
THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OB@@ LITER@@ ATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LAT@@ ITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOF@@ TNESS OF THEIR INFANT CRE@@ ED WOULD BE VARI@@ OUSLY M@@ OUL@@ DED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
YET THE MOST CHAR@@ ITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SE@@ CT@@ ARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DI@@ VIN@@ ITY OF CHRIST
HIS PROGRESS FROM IN@@ FANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STAT@@ URE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EX@@ PIR@@ ED ON THE CROSS
HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SO@@ CR@@ ATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STO@@ IC OR THE HERO MAY DIS@@ DA@@ IN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTE@@ E@@ MED THE PU@@ REST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
THE SON OF A VIRG@@ IN GENER@@ ATED BY THE INE@@ FF@@ ABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY AT@@ TRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE A@@ E@@ ONS THE LO@@ GO@@ S OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IM@@ MORTALITY
BUT THE PREVA@@ ILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERN@@ ITY AND INHER@@ ENT PRA@@ VITY OF MATTER INFE@@ CTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
MANY AMONG THE GEN@@ TILE PRO@@ SEL@@ Y@@ TES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELE@@ STI@@ AL SPIRIT AN UN@@ DIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESS@@ ENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMP@@ URE AND CON@@ TA@@ MIN@@ ATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DI@@ VIN@@ ITY THEY PI@@ OUSLY AB@@ J@@ URED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JOR@@ DAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OM@@ NI@@ POT@@ ENCE TO IM@@ ITATE THE FACUL@@ TIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IM@@ POSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
BUT THE R@@ ASH@@ NESS OF THESE CONCE@@ SSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MIL@@ DER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DO@@ CE@@ TES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMP@@ AS@@ SIBLE AND IN@@ CORRUP@@ TI@@ BLE BODY
A FO@@ E@@ T@@ US THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MAT@@ URITY A CHILD THAT COULD AT@@ TAIN THE STAT@@ URE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERI@@ VING ANY NOUR@@ ISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPA@@ IR@@ ING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NA@@ Z@@ ARE@@ TH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WIS@@ EST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELE@@ CTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENT TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DE@@ ITY
WHEN THE ME@@ SSI@@ AH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IM@@ MORTAL AND IMP@@ AS@@ SIBLE BEING FOR@@ SO@@ OK HIS EARTHLY TAB@@ ERN@@ ACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PL@@ ERO@@ MA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLA@@ IN AND TO EXP@@ IRE
BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESER@@ TION ARE STRONGLY QUESTI@@ ONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MAR@@ TY@@ R AT FIRST IMP@@ ELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVO@@ KE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROF@@ ANE
THEIR MURMUR@@ S WERE VARI@@ OUSLY SIL@@ ENCED BY THE SE@@ CT@@ ARIES WHO E@@ SP@@ OU@@ SED AND MODI@@ FIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CER@@ IN@@ THUS
THE WORTHY FRIEND OF A@@ THAN@@ A@@ SI@@ US THE WORTHY ANT@@ AGONI@@ ST OF JULI@@ AN HE BRA@@ VELY WRE@@ STLED WITH THE ARI@@ ANS AND PO@@ LY@@ THE@@ I@@ STS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIG@@ OR OF GEO@@ ME@@ TRI@@ CAL DE@@ MON@@ STRATION HIS COMM@@ ENT@@ ARIES REVEALED THE LITER@@ AL AND AL@@ LEG@@ OR@@ ICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIP@@ TURES

HE AC@@ QUIE@@ SC@@ ED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSO@@ PH@@ ERS BETWEEN THE RATI@@ ONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LO@@ GO@@ S FOR INTELLECTUAL FUN@@ CTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUB@@ ORDIN@@ ATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEAN@@ ER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLI@@ ANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTAN@@ TIAL IN@@ DIS@@ SOLU@@ BLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TR@@ INITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH
UNDER THE TU@@ ITION OF THE AB@@ BO@@ T SER@@ AP@@ ION HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO EC@@ CLE@@ SI@@ A@@ STICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDE@@ FATI@@ G@@ ABLE AR@@ DOR THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEP@@ LESS NIGHT HE HAS PER@@ USED THE FOUR GO@@ SP@@ ELS THE CATHOLIC EPI@@ STLES AND THE EPI@@ STLE TO THE ROMANS
AR@@ DENT IN THE PRO@@ SECU@@ TION OF HER@@ ES@@ Y CY@@ RI@@ L AU@@ SP@@ ICI@@ OUSLY OPENED HIS REIGN BY OP@@ PRESSING THE NO@@ V@@ ATI@@ ANS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARM@@ LESS OF THE SE@@ CT@@ ARIES

SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANI@@ MA@@ D@@ VER@@ SION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PROMIS@@ CU@@ OUS OU@@ TRA@@ GE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXAN@@ DRI@@ A WAS IM@@ POVER@@ ISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDU@@ STRIOUS COL@@ ONY
THE ZEAL OF CY@@ RI@@ L EXPOSED HIM TO THE PEN@@ AL@@ TIES OF THE JULI@@ AN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERNMENT AND A SUPER@@ ST@@ ITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMP@@ UNITY AND EVEN OF PRAISE
O@@ REST@@ ES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THEO@@ DO@@ SI@@ US AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PRA@@ E@@ FECT OF EGYPT
A RUM@@ OR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTI@@ ANS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THE@@ ON WAS THE ONLY OBST@@ ACLE TO THE RECON@@ CI@@ LI@@ ATION OF THE PRA@@ E@@ FECT AND THE ARCH@@ BIS@@ HOP AND THAT OBST@@ ACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED

THE VANITY OF CELE@@ STINE WAS FLAT@@ TERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VER@@ SION OF A MONK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE PO@@ PE WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLER@@ GY WAS IGNORANT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEO@@ LOGY OF THE GRE@@ EKS

RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AND SCAND@@ AL OF YOUR MEETING
THE FEEBLE SON OF AR@@ CA@@ DI@@ US WAS ALTERNAT@@ ELY SWA@@ YED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE E@@ UN@@ U@@ CH@@ S AND WOMEN OF THE PALACE SUPER@@ ST@@ ITION AND A@@ VAR@@ ICE WERE THEIR RU@@ LING PASSIONS AND THE OR@@ THO@@ DO@@ X CHIEFS WERE ASSI@@ DU@@ OUS IN THEIR ENDEAV@@ ORS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER
BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHURCH THEIR VO@@ W WAS SUPER@@ SE@@ DED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND IN@@ DISPEN@@ SA@@ BLE DUTY
AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVENUE OF THE THRONE WAS ASSA@@ UL@@ TED WITH GOLD
THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DIS@@ CONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORI@@ ENTAL BIS@@ HO@@ PS SUCCE@@ SSI@@ VELY DIS@@ ENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS UN@@ POPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECRE@@ ASED THE NUMBER OF THE SC@@ HI@@ SM@@ ATI@@ CS WHO RE@@ VERED NE@@ STOR@@ I@@ US AS THE CONFE@@ SSOR OF THE FAITH

HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND
THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVIC@@ T WAS FULL OF VIRGIN@@ ITY
HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM
HE SUFFERED ALL THE PAN@@ GS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING
ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INE@@ FF@@ ABLE LIGHT
COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING
SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPAN@@ SION
THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VAL@@ JEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HO@@ VEL PRETTY
NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VAL@@ JEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF
TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER
WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
MOREOVER JEAN VAL@@ JEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL
HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSI@@ ONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN
WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HO@@ VEL
COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING
AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY
HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UN@@ DRESSING HER DO@@ LL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PR@@ AT@@ TLE
THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EX@@ EMP@@ T FROM EGO@@ TI@@ STICAL THOUGHTS
HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QU@@ AF@@ FED FRESH BIT@@ TER@@ NESS DISGUST AND LAS@@ S@@ ITUDE WERE OVER@@ POW@@ ERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BIS@@ HOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY E@@ CLI@@ PSE THOUGH SURE TO RE@@ APPEAR LATER ON LU@@ MIN@@ OUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM
WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VAL@@ JEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE
ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDE@@ CIS@@ ION THAN COSETTE
HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STREN@@ G@@ TH@@ ENED HIM
HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PRO@@ P

HOW WE MUST SIMP@@ LI@@ FY
IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DIS@@ COR@@ DANT WITH THE VA@@ STNESS AND VARIETY THE RE@@ SERVES AND RESOURCES AND RE@@ CU@@ PER@@ ATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY
IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRU@@ DER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NA@@ I@@ VELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
WE RANGE WI@@ DER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
AND ALREADY THIS AST@@ OUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRAN@@ GEN@@ ESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FU@@ TILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD
FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARY OBSC@@ URED HER LIFE FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN
IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMIN@@ ATED MY MIND IN A STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JU@@ ST@@ IN
I BECAME GROTE@@ SQU@@ ELY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGHOUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER
YOU WERE WRONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE KEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU
WE NEVER PLANNED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET
IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING
BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH
AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL JEAL@@ OU@@ SIES AND THOUGH@@ TLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING
IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WO@@ MANHOOD AND FELLOW@@ SHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAM@@ T OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLU@@ TCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION
WHAT ALTER@@ NATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER

THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORN@@ CAKES AND SOR@@ GH@@ UM MOL@@ ASSES FOR THREE DAYS
I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDU@@ CTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES
HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART
AM@@ BRO@@ S@@ CH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER
HE STRUCK AM@@ BRO@@ S@@ CH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOW@@ INGLY
AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BU@@ SHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRA@@ ITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA
I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RA@@ VINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLA@@ ZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY
SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTT@@ ON@@ WOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME
ANTON@@ IA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE
SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WR@@ UNG HER HANDS
SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER
WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
AFTER ANTON@@ IA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHA@@ SED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEAR@@ CH@@ INGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY EL@@ DERS
IN ARISTOCR@@ ATIC COMMUN@@ ITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BUR@@ STS OF TUMUL@@ TUOUS AND BO@@ I@@ STER@@ OUS GA@@ YE@@ TY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIV@@ ATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCR@@ AC@@ IES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRI@@ LY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RE@@ SORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHU@@ TS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
I BELIEVE THE SER@@ IOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS AR@@ ISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUN@@ ITIES
THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMON@@ WEALTH ARE WHOLLY EN@@ GRO@@ SSED BY THE AC@@ QUIS@@ ITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH RE@@ PUBLI@@ CS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLA@@ TO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AF@@ FIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCR@@ AC@@ IES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
IN ARISTOCR@@ AC@@ IES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UN@@ CE@@ AS@@ INGLY PURSU@@ ES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPER@@ FECT NO@@ TIONS OF EACH
CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTI@@ OUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CEN@@ SURE AND IN@@ S@@ ATI@@ ABLE OF PRAISE
IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REP@@ LIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
IF I APP@@ LAU@@ D THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
IN ARISTOCR@@ ATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESS@@ ER ADVANTAGES WHICH AC@@ CRU@@ E TO THEM
THEY THEREFORE ENTER@@ TAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERI@@ ORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VA@@ UN@@ TING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEI@@ VES AND NO ONE CONTE@@ STS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TO@@ PIC@@ S OF CONVERSATION
THEY STAND UN@@ MOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
WHEN AN ARISTOCR@@ ACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSU@@ MES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IM@@ ITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PU@@ ERI@@ LE JEAL@@ OU@@ SIES WHICH ANIM@@ ATE THE MEN OF DEMOCR@@ AC@@ IES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNAT@@ CH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQU@@ ALS CONTE@@ STED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PAR@@ ADE O@@ ST@@ ENT@@ ATI@@ OUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
THE TWO STRA@@ Y KIT@@ TEN@@ S GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHA@@ SES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SURE DOESN'T GIVE HER AS@@ TH@@ MA

YOU KNOW I'D GET DRA@@ FTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
I'VE DECIDED TO EN@@ LIST IN THE ARMY
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM
HERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GAR@@ N@@ ERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
WHAT BAN@@ K@@ RUP@@ TS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME RE@@ MOR@@ SELESS CRED@@ ITOR SEI@@ ZES ON ALL WE FON@@ DLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TW@@ INS
THE GH@@ OU@@ L LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRA@@ VED WITH IMP@@ UNITY AND B@@ AU@@ L@@ KED OF ITS PREY
THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STO@@ KE CLA@@ Y@@ POLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCK@@ ING@@ HAM@@ SHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
MARGARET MET JE@@ M WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LAT@@ CH OF THE WIL@@ SONS DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HU@@ SHED QUIET WITHIN
SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD RO@@ CKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GAS@@ PING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SE@@ T@@ TEE IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WA@@ KENING HIM
WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
A@@ FORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YO HA@@ N HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS ST@@ UR@@ DY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
OH JE@@ M DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND@@ 'S TOUCH THRI@@ LLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPER@@ ING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
DON'T JE@@ M PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
MARY I ALMOST LOA@@ THE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RE@@ LEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
SO LEAVING KIND MES@@ SAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JE@@ M AND DECI@@ DING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DAR@@ KENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JE@@ M'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSE@@ SSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWN@@ CAST AND THAT I MUST GO ME@@ DDLING WI HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS A@@ UN@@ T'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWN@@ RIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREW@@ DNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRA@@ STED VERY BE@@ WIT@@ CH@@ INGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UN@@ WORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMAN@@ CES WHICH MISS SI@@ MMON@@ DS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMM@@ ENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
THE OLD LEA@@ VEN IN@@ FU@@ SED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FER@@ MENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVER@@ SION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOL@@ DED BY MISS SI@@ MMON@@ DS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GO@@ WNS FROM THE HASTY TEMP@@ ERED YET KIND DRE@@ SS@@ MAKER
BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLI@@ EST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE RE@@ DEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RE@@ LATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DIS@@ HEAR@@ TENED GLOOMY PERSON
THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GRE@@ ASING THEIR BOOTS MEN@@ DING THEIR SUSP@@ EN@@ DERS PLA@@ ITING WHI@@ PL@@ ASHES
ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR Y@@ UL@@ KA AND ANTON@@ IA EVEN Y@@ UL@@ KA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
SHE CUT SQUA@@ RES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SE@@ WED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROU@@ PED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERT@@ ISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HAT@@ CHE@@ T SL@@ UNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLAN@@ NING A SURPRISE FOR ME
I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JA@@ KE
HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SM@@ ELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
FROM UNDER THE LIN@@ ING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLI@@ ANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LA@@ MP@@ LIGHT JA@@ KE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RU@@ D@@ ELY M@@ OUL@@ DED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UN@@ FINISHED O@@ TTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE S@@ CAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CUR@@ L SO FERO@@ CI@@ OUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUST@@ ACHE
GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DEST@@ ITU@@ TE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER S@@ HIM@@ ER@@ DA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MIT@@ TEN@@ S HIS WIFE HAD KN@@ ITTED
HE SAT STILL AND PAS@@ SIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN RO@@ CKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELA@@ XED UPON THE ARMS
HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A TH@@ A@@ W AND BY NEW YEAR@@ 'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BRO@@ TH OF GRAY SLU@@ SH AND THE GU@@ TTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WIN@@ D@@ MILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS S@@ HIM@@ ER@@ DA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CAR@@ PE@@ TS AND CUR@@ TAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMM@@ ENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN EN@@ VIOUS COMPLA@@ INING TONE
YOUR MA@@ MA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
FOR AM@@ BRO@@ S@@ CH MY MA@@ MA COME HERE
BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRA@@ ITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BO@@ I@@ STER@@ OUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
YOU'VE GOT A BIRTH@@ DAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RES@@ ENTED HER PROTE@@ CTING MANNER
THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE S@@ HIM@@ ER@@ D@@ AS I FOUND ANTON@@ IA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PE@@ TER'S HOUSE TO BOR@@ ROW A SP@@ ADE AM@@ BRO@@ S@@ CH NEEDED
THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEAD@@ Y AS WINE
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRA@@ VEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
I WHIR@@ LED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRA@@ VEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFOR@@ T@@ INGLY
A FAINT FE@@ TI@@ D SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID O@@ O@@ ZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
LOOK TON@@ Y THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
I EXPLAINED TO ANTON@@ IA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
WE DECIDED THAT ANTON@@ IA SHOULD RIDE DU@@ DE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
I FOLLOWED WITH THE SP@@ ADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAG@@ GING MY SNAKE
O@@ TTO FU@@ CH@@ S WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
O@@ TTO WIN@@ KED AT ME
A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER S@@ HIM@@ ER@@ DA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EX@@ OR@@ BIT@@ ANT BON@@ US ON RENE@@ WING IT AND TO GIVE A MOR@@ T@@ GAGE ON HIS PI@@ GS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRAN@@ SAC@@ TIONS WITH CUTTER
SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SAN@@ D@@ WI@@ CHES AND DOU@@ GH@@ NUTS FOR US
WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HI@@ LL@@ SIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RE@@ TRE@@ ATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MO@@ ANING ON
I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESP@@ ISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DO@@ CI@@ LE
THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
HE SEEMED TO BE CUR@@ SING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRON@@ GED HIM
QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROU@@ P
ANT@@ ONI@@ A'S FATHER UN@@ COVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTH@@ MI@@ CALLY
FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
MISTER S@@ HIM@@ ER@@ DA WENT WITH HIM
AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
THE FIRST HO@@ W@@ LS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICK@@ ENING REPE@@ T@@ ITIONS
A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HIN@@ D@@ MOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLU@@ MP OF TREES AND OVER@@ TURNED
THE SHRI@@ EKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GRO@@ O@@ M'S THREE BL@@ ACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLE@@ DGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
AND THE WOLVES PA@@ VEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
YES HOW MANY
TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
PA@@ VEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
PETER CROU@@ CHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MON@@ A@@ STER@@ Y OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MO@@ INES FORT WA@@ YNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
DURING THE AU@@ CTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DE@@ PRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER S@@ HIM@@ ER@@ DA
WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
THIS CABIN WAS HIS HER@@ MIT@@ AGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNO@@ WS PEN@@ NED HIM IN HIS CAVE
THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES

IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNU@@ AL OB@@ L@@ ATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE E@@ CLI@@ PSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVER@@ THROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PRO@@ STRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HO@@ MAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE

AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOT@@ STEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION
MIN@@ NI@@ E'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESI@@ DENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BU@@ REN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LAB@@ OUR@@ ERS AND CLER@@ KS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
TO CAR@@ RI@@ E THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE C@@ ARS AS THEY TIN@@ K@@ LED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL
TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MON@@ THLY INST@@ AL@@ MENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE
HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN IN@@ TU@@ ITION
THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DIS@@ COR@@ DAN@@ TLY PA@@ PER@@ ED
THE FLO@@ ORS WERE COVERED WITH MAT@@ TING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN RA@@ G CARPET
THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HAN@@ SON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT
ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFF@@ SPRING
NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWE@@ DISH ACCENT NOTI@@ CE@@ ABLE IN HIS VOICE
HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
MIN@@ NIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR
SHE ASKED MIN@@ NIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MAN@@ TEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROU@@ E@@ T'S CARD AND WROTE HIM
SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID
ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID SAY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH
A SHOP GIRL WAS THE DESTINY PRE@@ FIGURED FOR THE NEW@@ COM@@ ER
IT WAS UNDER SUCH AU@@ SP@@ ICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENT@@ U@@ ALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE
IT GAVE AN IM@@ POSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLE@@ SALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET
THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY
HE WAS IN A FE@@ VERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE B@@ LIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENT@@ ALLY ARRAN@@ GING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION
HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAG@@ ERIAL POSITION
HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT
MANY LITTLE WR@@ INK@@ LES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMP@@ LATED THIS AND HIS BROW MO@@ I@@ STENED
HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFAC@@ TOR@@ ILY FOR CAR@@ RI@@ E WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOP@@ ES HAD BEEN SCAN@@ NED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESS@@ ENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERI@@ AL@@ ISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DROUET THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RU@@ MIN@@ ATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DRE@@ ARILY HEADED FOR THE MA@@ DIS@@ ON CAR
HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CAR@@ RI@@ E
FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECT@@ OR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL
BUT HE COMPROMIS@@ ED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMP@@ LATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH
LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRE@@ TION ASSERTED ITSELF
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLI@@ MA@@ X WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE
HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
THE LONG DRI@@ ZZ@@ LE HAD BEGUN PE@@ DE@@ STRI@@ ANS HAD TURNED UP COLL@@ ARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSI@@ ST@@ ENCY OF THIS THING
HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMB@@ RE@@ LL@@ A
HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING
HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMIS@@ ED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW
BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KE@@ ENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
THEN HE RANG THE BELL NO ANSWER
HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QU@@ AND@@ ARY THAN EVER
HE COULD HARDLY REAL@@ ISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FOR@@ MUL@@ ATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PAN@@ AC@@ E@@ A FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST UR@@ GENT MENTAL AF@@ FIR@@ MATION AND DENI@@ AL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOP@@ E PLACED IN IT THE REQUE@@ STED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SE@@ ALED IT UP
THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HAN@@ DING HIM THE ENVELOP@@ E AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT
THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUS@@ INGS
HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOP@@ E AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPH@@ ED
IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT
FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THERE@@ IN EN@@ ACTED
IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
THE HELPLESS MANAGER PAC@@ ED THE FLOOR AND GRI@@ MLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USH@@ ERED OUT THE SA@@ BB@@ ATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROO@@ DED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RE@@ SORT FROM CAR@@ RI@@ E AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE I@@ O@@ TA
IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANG@@ ERED AT HIS PER@@ FI@@ DY
HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMP@@ LIC@@ ATIONS
HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CAR@@ RI@@ E BUT WHEN HE GOT IN O@@ G@@ DEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PER@@ FUN@@ CT@@ OR@@ ILY TO EVERYBODY
HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QU@@ ITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCH@@ MAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
ON WE@@ DNE@@ SDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREG@@ OR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRU@@ CTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THUR@@ SDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE F@@ ILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIV@@ OR@@ CE AND ALI@@ MONY
VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMIS@@ E
SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SU@@ E HIM PROMPTLY
PRE@@ FACE TO SECOND ED@@ ITION
THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
ON MY RETURN I PUR@@ PO@@ SELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST RE@@ VIS@@ ES TO THE PRIN@@ TER
THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMIL@@ ARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
I REGRET THAT RE@@ VIE@@ WERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAP@@ TERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDU@@ CE MISTER DAR@@ WIN@@ 'S THEORY TO AN ABSUR@@ DITY
I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECI@@ OUS MIS@@ USE OF AN@@ ALO@@ GY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LE@@ VEL@@ LED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO RE@@ VIE@@ WER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUF@@ FICE
BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLA@@ IN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEI@@ VERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EX@@ PRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRIT@@ ICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LEN@@ I@@ ENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RAN@@ G@@ IT@@ ATA DISTRICT OF THE CAN@@ TER@@ BURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZE@@ AL@@ AND AND APPEARED AT CHRIST@@ CHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIR@@ TEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CON@@ SUMPTION
I SEE FROM MY SECOND PRE@@ FACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESS@@ R@@ S CHAP@@ MAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR RE@@ JE@@ CTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRIT@@ ERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRU@@ B@@ NER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
I AT@@ TRIBUTE ITS UN@@ LOOKED FOR SUCCESS MA@@ INLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE RE@@ VIEWS THE FIRST IN THE P@@ ALL M@@ ALL GA@@ ZE@@ TTE OF APRIL TWEL@@ F@@ TH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECT@@ ATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
THE FIRST ED@@ ITION OF ERE@@ WH@@ ON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN M@@ OUL@@ DS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTER@@ ATIONS BEFORE M@@ OUL@@ DS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW ED@@ ITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STER@@ E@@ OS THEN MADE
I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF ERE@@ WH@@ ON THAT WERE REPE@@ AT@@ EDLY RE@@ WRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE CO@@ PY@@ RIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXP@@ IRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY AN@@ TE@@ CE@@ DENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARR@@ ATIVE WOULD BE TE@@ DIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RE@@ AP ANY PE@@ C@@ UNI@@ ARY ADVANTAGE
NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO
I REACHED MY DEST@@ INATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HE@@ MIS@@ P@@ HERE I WAS
SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPI@@ DITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING IN@@ LAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN AC@@ RE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RAN@@ GES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPO@@ TTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BRE@@ EDING E@@ W@@ ES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK E@@ W@@ ES AND A BLACK LA@@ MB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGU@@ ISHING MARK WHERE@@ BY I COULD TELL THEM
IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
IT WAS A MONOTON@@ OUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRAN@@ DEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LA@@ MB BLE@@ ATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHT@@ FALL
I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WOR@@ KABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAP@@ ELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
MY GU@@ ID@@ ES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLIT@@ ENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENI@@ ENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYE@@ ING ME NOR I THEM
THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UN@@ PA@@ VED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
EVEN ON THIS LE@@ DGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A ST@@ UNTED GROWTH OF SHO@@ PLE@@ TS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGE@@ T@@ ATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MER@@ CAN@@ TILE OF THE B@@ LEA@@ KEST
EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED E@@ Y@@ ELI@@ DS E@@ YEL@@ ASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TI@@ MI@@ DLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWIL@@ DER@@ MENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVER@@ SION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COM@@ ELY AND THE OLD GREY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL
I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVER@@ ENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY AB@@ ASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMP@@ OUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGY@@ P@@ TI@@ AN GREEK AND ITALIAN
THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVA@@ ILING BEAUTY
I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GU@@ ID@@ ES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIV@@ ATED EVERY LE@@ DGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHE@@ ST@@ NUTS WAL@@ NUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GU@@ ID@@ ES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INK@@ LING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
SUF@@ FICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND C@@ OUGH@@ ED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUP@@ PRESS IT
THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVEL@@ L@@ OUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE IN@@ MOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RU@@ ST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESI@@ G@@ NED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RA@@ ILS
WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLO@@ CKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WAT@@ CHES
THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CAL@@ MING HIM
HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO REL@@ ENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KIN@@ DER MANNER
I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRIST@@ MAS@@ ES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHO@@ P IN MY CHA@@ MBERS OR HORROR OF HOR@@ RORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LU@@ C@@ Y'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTI@@ VE SEASON
FESTI@@ VE YES
THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAW@@ LING FEMIN@@ INE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FE@@ E WOULD COVER
THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD
THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMO@@ DATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDI@@ LE@@ CTION FOR THE NAME MA@@ DGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MA@@ DGE AND YET FROM MY BOY@@ HOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MA@@ DGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO
I HAD NO ILLU@@ SIONS
I DID NOT EXPECT A PRIN@@ CELY ENTERTAINMENT
ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RA@@ INING
I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PRE@@ PO@@ STER@@ OUS
I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MA@@ DGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY
HE WAS IMPER@@ VIOUS TO REASON
IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CRO@@ F@@ TON MY JOUR@@ NE@@ Y'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WIT@@ TED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATI@@ ON@@ MASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HU@@ L@@ KING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HAN@@ GAR DEN@@ E THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PL@@ OUGH@@ ED FIELDS MY IN@@ FORM@@ ANT DID NOT MENTION
THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY AND BL@@ UNDER@@ BU@@ SS BUT THAT REQUIRED FET@@ CHING
WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UN@@ COMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART
IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LU@@ GG@@ AGE
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
I WAS CHIL@@ LED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EX@@ TIN@@ CT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENT@@ URING IN QUEST OF ONE
HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
THERE'S A KNO@@ CK@@ ER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF
THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNO@@ CK@@ ER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS R@@ OUS@@ ING
THE BELL REVER@@ BER@@ ATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PA@@ IRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLE@@ AMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
A VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE
THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UN@@ COMMONLY LIKE A CHOR@@ US OF LAUGHTER
THERE WAS A RUSH OF RE@@ TRE@@ ATING FEET AN EX@@ PO@@ STU@@ LATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
I TOL@@ LED THE BELL AGAIN
AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UN@@ FA@@ STENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
I'M MISTER CHRIST@@ OP@@ HER FROM LONDON
WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CEL@@ LAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SN@@ ELL@@ INGS
I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANN@@ 'S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE@@ 'S WEDDING SO UN@@ IMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
THE GIRL IS FRE@@ TTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED
THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE
I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SN@@ ELL@@ INGS FOR POSSE@@ SSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANN@@ 'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPR@@ INGS
THERE SHE OW@@ NS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PI@@ G@@ ST@@ YE FOR ALL I KNOW
WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY AN@@ N SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONE@@ Y@@ MOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PI@@ G@@ ST@@ YE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FAL@@ TERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECT@@ ATIONS
IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECT@@ ATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGH@@ TFULLY IN FACT
I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BU@@ SH@@ ' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT
AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIR@@ KING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
HERS HAS BEEN PRODI@@ GI@@ OUS
SHE HAS A KN@@ ACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIR@@ AC@@ UL@@ OUS
I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TEN@@ DERED THEIR OFF@@ ER@@ INGS
THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY AN@@ N A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RAN@@ COR@@ OUS AC@@ IDITY WHICH TO ME IS IN@@ EXP@@ LI@@ CABLE
SUCH IS THE SEL@@ FISH@@ NESS OF HUMAN NATURE
BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY AN@@ N PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHI@@ TING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MAC@@ PHER@@ SON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MAC@@ PHER@@ SON HAS MARY AN@@ N GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
SOMEONE S@@ NI@@ GG@@ ERED
I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUP@@ POSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SN@@ ELL@@ INGS MOVE
AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE REN@@ DING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
P S THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING
WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONE@@ Y@@ MOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANN@@ 'S IS IN THE COO@@ K'S T@@ OURS LINE
HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COU@@ P@@ ONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COU@@ P@@ ONS AND RAIL@@ WAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE
HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LUR@@ KED IN HIS WINE
I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED
SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVER@@ EST PO@@ IS@@ ONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW
A LOW CONFUSED MO@@ AN WAN@@ ED FROM HIS MOUTH
THE MAN SHRU@@ GGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE AR@@ ABE@@ SQUE CHAMBER
THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CA@@ MEL HAIR ROBE AND SAN@@ DALS AND A GREEN TUR@@ B@@ AN WAS ON HIS HEAD
NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NE@@ CRO@@ MAN@@ CY
WITH A LONG STAINED FING@@ ER@@ NA@@ IL HE MA@@ PPED THE CONST@@ ELL@@ ATIONS ON THE MARBLE TI@@ LED FLOOR
THE SL@@ ANT OF THE MOON PRE@@ SA@@ GED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VEN@@ D@@ HY@@ A THE STARS ARE IN TUR@@ MO@@ IL THE SERP@@ ENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELE@@ PH@@ ANT
POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER
ALL DIS@@ CAR@@ DED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INT@@ AN@@ GIBLE CONNE@@ CTIONS
BUT AT THE UR@@ GENT ENTRE@@ ATY OF THE PRINCESS OF K@@ HO@@ SAL@@ A WHO LOVED B@@ HUN@@ DA CH@@ AND VA@@ INLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TO@@ KEN OF REMEMBRANCE
BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GUL@@ FS OF ECHO@@ ING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE M@@ AT
ON THE DA@@ IS UNDER THE GOLDEN DO@@ ME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RAC@@ KED BY AWFUL PAR@@ OX@@ Y@@ S@@ MS
THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER COR@@ D THAT BIN@@ DS ME TO MY DYING BODY
THEY CLU@@ STER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TAL@@ ONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
THEIR FINGERS SE@@ AR ME LIKE FIRE
I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PY@@ RE
THERE THEY STRO@@ VE TO BREAK THE SILVER COR@@ D OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIR@@ D THEIR SOR@@ CER@@ Y SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH
YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
THERE WAS THE OLD IMPER@@ IOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER
YOU HAVE NEVER DIS@@ OBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO AS@@ URA
THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CAL@@ EN@@ DAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DO@@ MA
BILL CHAN@@ D@@ LER THE ZO@@ O@@ LOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SY@@ R@@ TIS
THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM AR@@ CHA@@ E@@ O@@ LOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
THE CIVILI@@ AN SPECI@@ ALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TA@@ PE LINES AND MAKING SKE@@ TCHES AND SNAPPING CA@@ MER@@ AS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SY@@ R@@ TIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OX@@ Y@@ GEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOO@@ SELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLAS@@ SED AS A REP@@ TILE AND A CAR@@ NI@@ V@@ OROUS MA@@ M@@ MAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIR@@ D@@ LIKE CLAWS AND A HER@@ BI@@ V@@ ORE ALMOST IDENTI@@ CAL WITH THE PI@@ G@@ LIKE THING IN THE BIG DAR@@ F@@ HU@@ L@@ VA MUR@@ AL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GA@@ Z@@ EL@@ LE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
THE DAILY NEW@@ S@@ CA@@ STS FROM TER@@ RA SHOWED A CORRESPON@@ DING SHI@@ FT IN INTEREST AT HOME
TON@@ Y'S FOUND THE MARTIANS
IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TOR@@ CH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
GLOR@@ IA STAN@@ DISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE ME@@ ZZ@@ AN@@ INE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADI@@ OP@@ H@@ ONE EXTEN@@ SION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM
WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION
MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVE@@ Y THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE ED@@ GES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
A F@@ LOO@@ D@@ LIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LAT@@ TI@@ MER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
MASS SU@@ ICI@@ DE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
YES CHAR@@ COAL
SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHAR@@ COAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
THE TER@@ RAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
TON@@ Y LAT@@ TI@@ MER THE DISCOVER@@ ER WAS BEGINNING TO C@@ ASH IN ON HIS ATTEN@@ TIONS TO GLOR@@ IA AND HIS ING@@ RATI@@ ATION WITH SI@@ D HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELE@@ CAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLAN@@ ET
WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVER@@ NIGHT THE MOST WID@@ ELY KNOWN AR@@ CHA@@ E@@ O@@ LOGIST IN HISTORY
NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DIS@@ CLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELE@@ CAST FROM TER@@ RA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRA@@ MATI@@ ZE IT
SO I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
LE@@ CTURES
THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN AR@@ CHA@@ E@@ O@@ LOGY WITH ANTHONY LAT@@ TI@@ MER PH D THE LOGICAL CAN@@ DI@@ DATE FOR THE CHAIR
I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE REPLIED
INSIDE A SECRET RO@@ CKET TELE@@ ME@@ TERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND
THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TE@@ STING R@@ OUT@@ INE IS IT
ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPP@@ ENING OUTSIDE
ELECT@@ RON@@ IC EQUI@@ P@@ MENT CAS@@ CA@@ DED FROM THE WALL SHEL@@ VES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HO@@ IST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUN@@ GING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRI@@ FYING CR@@ ASH
AN INSTANT LATER IT CR@@ ASHED OVER PIN@@ NING MARK F@@ AB@@ ER BENEATH IT
BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRE@@ CK@@ AGE
THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN ST@@ UNNED BY SOME FALLING DE@@ BR@@ IS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
TO@@ M'S EYES FO@@ CU@@ SED IN HORROR ON THE WRE@@ CK@@ AGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BIL@@ LOWING DUST
THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL G@@ AP@@ ING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SA@@ GGING DANGER@@ OUSLY ON ITS SUPPOR@@ TING TRU@@ SSES
THE YOUNG INVENT@@ OR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PIN@@ NED BENEATH A HEAVY BE@@ AM NE@@ AR@@ BY
HIS FRIEND'S E@@ Y@@ ELI@@ DS FLICK@@ ERED
WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM TOM DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AM@@ BUL@@ ANCE
THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRE@@ CK@@ AGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION
LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER F@@ AB@@ ER
AND THE ONLY TRU@@ CK WE HAD AVA@@ IL@@ ABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY
ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US
WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RU@@ BBLE AND EX@@ TRI@@ C@@ ATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRA@@ PPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPA@@ IR@@ ED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHI@@ CLES BEGAN ARRI@@ VING FROM HAR@@ KNESS FIRE TRU@@ CKS THREE AM@@ BUL@@ ANCES AND PRIVATE C@@ ARS DRIVEN BY VOL@@ UN@@ TE@@ ERS
THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UP@@ SET AS TO@@ M'S MOTHER TOM LAUGHED
MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WOR@@ RIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SAN@@ DY HAD BEEN
HE SMILED GUIL@@ TILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF
HE'S A GREAT SCIENTI@@ ST
TOM NODDED UN@@ HAPPILY
MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL
MISTER SWIF@@ T'S EYES TW@@ INKLED
FORTUNATELY WILL HAL@@ LEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MA@@ STS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
JOHN MAN@@ GLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRI@@ EVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DIS@@ COMFORT FROM THE DEFE@@ CTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTR@@ ACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UN@@ HING@@ ED
MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DIS@@ SER@@ TATION ON THE PA@@ MP@@ AS OR AU@@ STR@@ ALIA HIS LE@@ CTURES ON NEW ZE@@ AL@@ AND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
HIS EYES WANDERED CE@@ AS@@ ELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
WHAT THEN MY LORD
GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
THINK OF LADY GL@@ EN@@ AR@@ VAN THINK OF MARY GRANT
WILL HAL@@ LEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHI@@ P'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUN@@ CAN GOD FOR@@ BID
THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WA@@ HI@@ TI RAN@@ GES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
THE MEAL ENDED
SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABE@@ Y@@ ANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR E@@ Y@@ ELI@@ DS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PRO@@ LONGED WATCHING
IF IT IS DECRE@@ ED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRA@@ VELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
GOD WHO RE@@ ADS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
GL@@ EN@@ AR@@ VAN@@ 'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FAL@@ TERED
JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HEL@@ EN@@ A WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FUL@@ FILL THAT PROMISE
MY LORD WHI@@ CHE@@ VER OF US SURVI@@ VES THE OTHER WILL FUL@@ FILL THE WISH OF LADY HEL@@ EN@@ A AND MARY GRANT
AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
THE JA@@ IL@@ ER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FOR@@ GETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
LISTEN SAID HE MOTI@@ ONING THEM TO STO@@ OP
ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
WILSON AND OL@@ B@@ INE@@ TT JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DI@@ G THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAG@@ GER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MUL@@ RA@@ DY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CRE@@ VICE OF THE MAT@@ TING
WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT
DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHAR@@ P@@ NESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LA@@ YER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
JOHN MAN@@ GLES IN@@ SER@@ TING THE BLA@@ DE OF HIS P@@ ONI@@ ARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PRO@@ TRU@@ DED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WI@@ EL@@ DED IT
BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GL@@ EN@@ AR@@ VAN AND SEI@@ ZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KIS@@ SES
WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID RO@@ BERT
ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG CO@@ IL OF FLA@@ X ROPE
MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HEL@@ EN@@ A THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
THE SWEETEST PERFU@@ MES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUN@@ TAINS WITH THEIR SONGS
WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STO@@ RE@@ HOUSE
THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OP@@ ENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
WALK DOWN THE SLO@@ PING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE C@@ ARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MAR@@ KING OF GREAT TREE TR@@ UNKS LYING AS@@ L@@ ANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PAL@@ M LEAVES STRE@@ WED AMONG THEM
HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SP@@ LIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNU@@ GLY AS DOES ANY CHE@@ ST@@ NUT IN ITS BU@@ R
FER@@ NS AND PAL@@ MS MO@@ SSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLA@@ ZING IN AN OPEN FIRE@@ PLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FU@@ EL
WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FER@@ NS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MO@@ SSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PAL@@ M LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
THEN THE HILLS WERE P@@ ILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TIL@@ TED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MA@@ KERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR
WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GL@@ Y@@ CER@@ IN TO HE@@ AL THEM
ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ER@@ A LAB@@ OURS UNDER A TROU@@ BLE@@ SOME DIS@@ ADVANTAGE
IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DIS@@ ADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HE@@ IN@@ OUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEA@@ THEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APO@@ LOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DEC@@ ENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH@@ 'S CASE FAR MORE WEA@@ KLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE
NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IM@@ MORALITY ATT@@ ACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSO@@ PH@@ ERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGH@@ TE@@ TH EVERY MAN WHICH COME@@ TH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRA@@ VING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOL@@ ATED PHILOSO@@ PH@@ ERS OR PROPHE@@ TS

JULI@@ AN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAG@@ AN@@ ISM BY IMP@@ ERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UN@@ CHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FA@@ IN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH@@ 'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HO@@ MAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POOR@@ ER BRE@@ THRE@@ N AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERI@@ ORS

THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCH@@ MEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOL@@ VED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RE@@ LIN@@ QU@@ ISH FOR EVER HER CLA@@ IMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATIS@@ FI@@ ER OF THE HUMAN SOUL
BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CRE@@ ED WHICH IT PROFE@@ SSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HO@@ LINESS OF A FEW GREAT EC@@ CLE@@ SI@@ AST@@ ICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS

THERE IS FRUIT WITH L@@ ENTI@@ LS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH
STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GRO@@ VEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS

THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
BUT NEITHER THE GL@@ ORI@@ FIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE
THEN FELL THE GLO@@ AMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FOR@@ BIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS

TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRON@@ GH@@ OLD OF THE MO@@ DO@@ CS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFI@@ ANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK

THUS THE SHA@@ STA RIVER ISSU@@ ES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHA@@ STA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIR@@ DS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GU@@ SHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CON@@ FLU@@ ENCE WITH THE PIT@@ T RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RO@@ DS
THE VIVID GREEN OF THE B@@ OUL@@ DERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FO@@ AM

EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DO@@ OMED TO BE TRA@@ MPLED AND HAR@@ RIED
WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WI@@ DO@@ WER
GEORGE NODDED
THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHAL@@ LON@@ ER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
GEORGE
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SU@@ ICI@@ DE
I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTER@@ NATIVE IS SO IMPRO@@ BABLE
THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FUR@@ TIVE WAT@@ CHER
I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
JUST AN EVERY@@ DAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOR@@ OUGH
YES HE'S MER@@ CURI@@ AL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
WHAT DOES HE WANT
I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMM@@ ONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
I EMP@@ HAS@@ ISED COMP@@ LAC@@ ENTLY
HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GR@@ Y@@ CE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOL@@ VING JUST SUCH BAF@@ FLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLU@@ RE@@ MENT FOR HIM
THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHA@@ T
IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LAT@@ TER'S FACE RELA@@ XED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELI@@ ANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETE@@ CTI@@ VE@@ 'S BUN@@ DLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
IT'S THE MOST IN@@ EXP@@ LI@@ CABLE THERE
BUT CLE@@ WS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GR@@ Y@@ CE
THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COL@@ LAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
IN OL@@ DEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOL@@ T FROM HEAVEN
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GR@@ Y@@ CE
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HO@@ VERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
THIS SWEE@@ TW@@ AT@@ ER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTE@@ GES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PI@@ ONE@@ ER ME
WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OP@@ ENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LO@@ BBY BELOW
ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSI@@ CIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
MARK SO@@ WER@@ BY AND CLA@@ US HEN@@ NER@@ BER@@ G
HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LO@@ BBY
ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
YES MISS CL@@ AR@@ KE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PAR@@ R@@ ISHES
I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
YES MISTER S@@ LATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LO@@ BBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE EL@@ AP@@ SED
NO DOUBT
SWEE@@ TW@@ AT@@ ER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
WHEREVER SHE PLEAS@@ ES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HU@@ STLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEU@@ MATIC INVAL@@ ID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEE@@ TW@@ AT@@ ER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GR@@ Y@@ CE
THERE WAS NO DOUB@@ TING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
YES
FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSI@@ CIANS GALLERY
YES MANY TIMES
WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
MISS CL@@ AR@@ KE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QU@@ ERI@@ ED MUS@@ INGLY
NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
THERE WAS NO P@@ ONI@@ ARD IN THE WOUND
THE TIME IS NAR@@ ROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CL@@ AR@@ KE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
SWEE@@ TW@@ AT@@ ER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
BUT VIG@@ OUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CL@@ AR@@ KE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEV@@ ATOR
THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
NO WEAPON PRO@@ TRU@@ DED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE ME@@ ZZ@@ AN@@ INE WHAT FOLLOWS
SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADD@@ ITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OP@@ ENINGS INTO THE LO@@ BBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE EN@@ SUR@@ ED ME AN HON@@ OURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITER@@ ARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND EN@@ DO@@ WED WITH THOSE ACCI@@ DENT@@ AL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PAS@@ SPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOL@@ LOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGH@@ TLY ADMIRED MEDI@@ OC@@ R@@ ITY IS AS RIGH@@ TLY DESP@@ ISED
I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DI@@ VIN@@ ITY AS AN EC@@ CLE@@ SI@@ ASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VO@@ CATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY D@@ INT OF HYPO@@ CRIS@@ Y AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESP@@ I@@ CABLE IN MY OWN ESTI@@ MATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MAN@@ TLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGN@@ ITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPEN@@ SES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
OUR SCAND@@ AL@@ OUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER
WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RA@@ MBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENT@@ ING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPER@@ TIN@@ ENT PRACTICAL JO@@ KES
WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH
WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRI@@ VE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGH@@ TEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL RO@@ PES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCH@@ WAR@@ DENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMON@@ ING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLO@@ ITS
IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PAR@@ ISHES OF THE CITY OF VEN@@ ICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MA@@ GA@@ ZZ@@ IN@@ O
YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BEN@@ CHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
THE WA@@ IT@@ ER OF THE MA@@ GA@@ ZZ@@ IN@@ O CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJO@@ INING SILENCE UNDER PEN@@ ALTY OF DEATH
WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THAN@@ KING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NO@@ CTUR@@ NAL OR@@ GY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPA@@ IR@@ ED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
THERE WAS NO CO@@ WARDLY TRA@@ ITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NO@@ CTUR@@ NAL P@@ RANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GON@@ DOL@@ A SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF IN@@ DISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NU@@ MB@@ NESS WAS SPRE@@ ADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
I JUMPED OUT OF THE GON@@ DOL@@ A AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RA@@ ZE@@ TTA SUCH A FOR@@ CI@@ BLE LESSON I EN@@ QUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPRO@@ VING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRE@@ SCRIBED BY ME
THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE
HE HAD GAMB@@ LED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS IN@@ FAT@@ U@@ ATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TER@@ R@@ O HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APP@@ LYING A MER@@ CURI@@ AL O@@ INT@@ MENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
HE ENTRE@@ ATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF IN@@ FORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMER@@ AL CAL@@ CU@@ LU@@ S WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
I OBEYED IMP@@ LIC@@ IT@@ LY AND MET YOUR EXCELLEN@@ CY
THE THREE FRIENDS WERE AST@@ OUNDED
I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CAL@@ CU@@ LU@@ S
NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HER@@ MIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDI@@ CTION
THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSO@@ PHER@@ 'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PAN@@ AC@@ E@@ A THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELE@@ MENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRE@@ TS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY OR@@ ACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIR@@ ED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTI@@ ANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVO@@ TE@@ ES AND FULL OF SCRU@@ PLES
AS FOR THE EU@@ CHAR@@ IST TRAN@@ SUBSTAN@@ TI@@ ATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PAL@@ P@@ ABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JE@@ SUITS
I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UN@@ DECEIVED THEM
BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLAT@@ TERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECUL@@ ATIVE CHA@@ TTERING OF EMPTY FOO@@ LS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMEN@@ ON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDE@@ B@@ TED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GON@@ DOL@@ A AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQU@@ INS A MONTH
YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVIS@@ ER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENI@@ AL WITH WHICH DOR@@ RI@@ FORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HOR@@ TON THAT LORD FREDER@@ ICK@@ 'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TOR@@ TURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCER@@ ITY OF HIS AFFECTION
EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERE@@ TO@@ FORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH AR@@ DOUR THAT MISS WOOD@@ LEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMP@@ ASSI@@ ON@@ ATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
YET DID THE WATCH@@ FUL MISS WOOD@@ LEY OFTEN@@ TIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVER@@ SPREAD HER FACE
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLA@@ MOUR OF HER RETURN
I HOPE MISS MIL@@ NER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
I THOUGHT MISS MIL@@ NER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
MISSUS HOR@@ TON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DE@@ CAN@@ TERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFIC@@ IOUS LAB@@ OURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWK@@ WAR@@ DNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BU@@ STLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
MISS MIL@@ NER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HOR@@ TON BESEE@@ CHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAG@@ NE@@ TIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER@@ 'S
DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MIL@@ NER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADI@@ CTION TO HIS WILL
IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING
MISS WOOD@@ LEY OBE@@ DI@@ ENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPER@@ TIN@@ ENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRA@@ INT SHE SUFFERED
AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DOR@@ RI@@ FORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EV@@ IN@@ CED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PA@@ MPH@@ LET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCER@@ N THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
MISS WOOD@@ LEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GING@@ LE OF A TEA SPO@@ ON WAS LIKE A DEEP T@@ ONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
MISSUS HOR@@ TON TOO IN THE SELF APPRO@@ VING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTER@@ CATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHAR@@ ITABLE
MISS WOOD@@ LEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTIN@@ CTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
HE C@@ OUGH@@ ED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MIL@@ NER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
DOR@@ RI@@ FORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PAR@@ D@@ ONED
AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HOR@@ TON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DU@@ TI@@ FUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MIL@@ NER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
DOR@@ RI@@ FORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
IT IS OFTEN THE UN@@ GRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROU@@ BLE@@ SOME SOMETIMES UN@@ MAN@@ NER@@ LY
FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT RO@@ BS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCER@@ ITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FOR@@ GIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FOR@@ CI@@ BLY EX@@ PRE@@ ST
SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMP@@ AN@@ YING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESI@@ STED
ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHE@@ W YOUR SUB@@ MISSION BY OBE@@ YING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY
KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUM@@ SPE@@ CTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMP@@ LIED WITH
IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MIL@@ BOR@@ OUGH SHE HAD SCOL@@ DED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO N@@ AP@@ LES
AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SA@@ MU@@ EL BO@@ ZZ@@ LE THE EX POLICE@@ MAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE V@@ INDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
MISSUS BO@@ ZZ@@ LE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTI@@ MATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EAR@@ N HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXER@@ TIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HAND@@ LED BY THE LAW@@ YERS
A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TRE@@ VEL@@ Y@@ AN ON TRE@@ VEL@@ Y@@ AN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BO@@ ZZ@@ LE
THE PAT@@ ER@@ NAL PA@@ RENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INF@@ ANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BO@@ ZZ@@ LE'S LAW
HE CAN'T SU@@ CKLE EM CAN HE
WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BO@@ ZZ@@ LE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BO@@ ZZ@@ LE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
DR@@ AT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
TRE@@ VEL@@ Y@@ AN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRU@@ CTION RECEIVED
DOES ONE MISTER SA@@ MU@@ EL BO@@ ZZ@@ LE LIVE HERE ASKED TRE@@ VEL@@ Y@@ AN
THEN BO@@ ZZ@@ LE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
BUT TRE@@ VEL@@ Y@@ AN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGU@@ STED AND REVOL@@ TED MOST UN@@ REAS@@ ONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINI@@ STER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
BO@@ ZZ@@ LE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRU@@ SHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BO@@ ZZ@@ LE TO CARRY DEC@@ ENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TRE@@ VEL@@ Y@@ AN
MISSUS BO@@ ZZ@@ LE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
BO@@ ZZ@@ LE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTT@@ ONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TRE@@ VEL@@ Y@@ AN
IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SK@@ INT SIR SUGGESTED BO@@ ZZ@@ LE
AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWN@@ WARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHU@@ FF@@ LING GA@@ IT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MIN@@ DING OF HIS PARLI@@ AM@@ ENT@@ ARY DUTIES
I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
AND BO@@ ZZ@@ LE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BO@@ ZZ@@ LE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF ST@@ ONY WALK
MASTER AND MAN DIS@@ MOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NO@@ ON@@ TIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASS THE GATES OF SLEEP
BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND RO@@ AMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MON@@ TE@@ SIN@@ OS AND SAW DUL@@ C@@ INE@@ A TRANS@@ FORMED INTO A COUNTRY WEN@@ CH SKI@@ PPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MER@@ LIN WERE S@@ OUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXER@@ TIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DIS@@ ENCHAN@@ T@@ MENT OF DUL@@ C@@ INE@@ A
WHO IS TOUCHING ME AND UN@@ TRU@@ SSING ME
DUL@@ C@@ INE@@ A IS PER@@ ISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGAR@@ DLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DE@@ FERRED THEREFORE UN@@ TRU@@ SS THY@@ SELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND L@@ ASHES
SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRA@@ PP@@ LING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRI@@ PPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
HOW NOW TRA@@ ITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
DO@@ ST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD
DO@@ ST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD
DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRE@@ TION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOME@@ BODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF
SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UN@@ BRI@@ DLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEF@@ EN@@ C@@ ELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTO@@ LS THEY CALL PE@@ TR@@ ON@@ ELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
HE SAW THAT HIS S@@ QUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PAN@@ ZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESI@@ ST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIR@@ DLE ESCAPED
HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SE@@ CLU@@ DED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO SPARE FOR FOLLOWING HER HEAD@@ LONG IMPULSES
IN A WORD HE PLE@@ DGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT CARRYING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD P@@ LIGHTED TO SO GREAT BEAUTY
NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY KN@@ ACK OF MAT@@ CH@@ MAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARRY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECU@@ TORS THE ENCHAN@@ TERS CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LAC@@ QUE@@ Y'S THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE ONE THIS MINUTE
THEY MADE HASTE TO OVER@@ TAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGN@@ ISING CLA@@ U@@ DIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MER@@ ITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID CLA@@ U@@ DIA THAT THOU W@@ ERT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARRY LE@@ ON@@ ORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH BAL@@ VA@@ STR@@ O

CRUEL RECK@@ LESS WOMAN SHE CRIED HOW EASILY W@@ ERT THOU MOVED TO CARRY OUT A THOUGHT SO WICKED
O HUSBAND WHOSE UNHAPPY FATE IN BEING MINE HATH BORNE THEE FROM THE MARRIAGE BED TO THE GRAVE
THE SERVANTS WEPT CLA@@ U@@ DIA SWO@@ ONED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE WHOLE PLACE SEEMED A FIELD OF SORROW AND AN ABO@@ DE OF MISFORTUNE
CLA@@ U@@ DIA TOLD HIM SHE MEANT TO GO TO A MON@@ A@@ STER@@ Y OF WHICH AN AUNT OF HERS WAS ABBE@@ SS WHERE SHE INTENDED TO PASS HER LIFE WITH A BETTER AND EVERLASTING SP@@ OUSE
CLA@@ U@@ DIA WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW HIM TO ACCOMPANY HER AND THAN@@ KING HIM FOR HIS OFFERS AS WELL AS SHE COULD TOOK LEAVE OF HIM IN TEARS
SANCHO SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KER@@ CHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MAN
SAID ONE OF THE BY@@ STAN@@ DERS I HAVE GOT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT WORTH THREE RE@@ ALS
AT THIS INSTANT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE S@@ QUIRES WHO WERE PO@@ STED AS SENT@@ IN@@ ELS ON THE ROADS TO WATCH WHO CAME ALONG THEM AND REPORT WHAT PASSED TO THEIR CHIEF CAME UP AND SAID SEN@@ OR THERE IS A GREAT TROOP OF PEOPLE NOT FAR OFF COMING ALONG THE ROAD TO BAR@@ CEL@@ ON@@ A
WHAT LED ME INTO IT WAS A CERTAIN THIRST FOR VENGEANCE WHICH IS STRONG ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE QUIE@@ TEST HEARTS
AND IF YOU HAVE ANY DESIRE TO SHOR@@ TEN THE JOURNEY AND PUT YOURSELF EASILY IN THE WAY OF SALVATION COME WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO BECOME A KNIGHT ER@@ RANT A CALLING WHEREIN SO MANY HARD@@ SHIPS AND MIS@@ HAPS ARE ENCOUNTERED THAT IF THEY BE TAKEN AS PEN@@ ANCES THEY WILL LODGE YOU IN HEAVEN IN A TRI@@ CE

THE CAP@@ TAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE RE@@ GENT@@ 'S LADY WAS DOWN@@ CAST AND THE PILGRI@@ MS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CON@@ FIS@@ CATED
THE RE@@ GENT@@ 'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROW@@ NS THAT HAD BEEN ASSE@@ SSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAP@@ TAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY
ONE OF THE S@@ QUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GAS@@ C@@ ON AND CAT@@ AL@@ AN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRI@@ AR THAN HIGH@@ WA@@ YMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS

TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
HE SM@@ ELT THE NU@@ T@@ TY AR@@ O@@ MA OF THE SPIRIT
THAT AT ALL TIMES DE@@ BAS@@ ING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS IN@@ FAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUB@@ LY SIN@@ FUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN
IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CU@@ P@@ BOARD WITH THE BOTTLE AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LU@@ DI@@ CR@@ OUS AND HORRIBLE
HER MEETING WITH LET@@ TY WAS INDESCRI@@ B@@ ABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NUR@@ SING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEG@@ RU@@ DGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
SO CHRISTI@@ E TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHE@@ TIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BL@@ IS@@ S@@ FUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANY THING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUA@@ KER@@ ISH LOVER DANCING A J@@ I@@ G
I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
I'M NOT A TAL@@ KER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAV@@ ITATION FOR@@ BID MY SO@@ ARING AL@@ OFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UP@@ LIFTED STATE OF MIND BY P@@ RAN@@ CING AS YOU CALL IT
I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BIT@@ TEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LET@@ TY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IM@@ PETU@@ OUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CHRISTI@@ E AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT
EXCELL@@ ENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IM@@ PETU@@ OSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SHOW
THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TW@@ INED SMIL@@ A@@ X WRE@@ A@@ THS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPAR@@ K IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UN@@ SPOKEN APPREHENSION
IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS
DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRAT@@ EFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FI@@ XING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DE@@ ARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMP@@ T AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NO@@ BLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEE@@ THE@@ ART ANSWERED BRA@@ VELY FORGETTING IN THE FER@@ V@@ OR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
BENNET WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
HE'S A KIND NEIGHBOR@@ LY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
I KNEW YOU WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTI@@ E SE@@ ALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SIL@@ ENCED HIM
YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO
NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STER@@ LING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQU@@ IL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KN@@ ELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UN@@ SOLDI@@ ER@@ LY CHO@@ KE IN THE VOICE
THE LOY@@ AL FREN@@ ZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KN@@ AP@@ SAC@@ KS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHO@@ W@@ ERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
FINDING THAT L@@ ISH@@ A SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROU@@ SE HIM BY PATRIO@@ TIC APPE@@ ALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WIL@@ KINS RESOLU@@ TELY TO HERSELF EF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOM@@ MI@@ CK AND SEE HOW THAT@@ 'LL WORK
WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE V@@ IT@@ TLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFER@@ IN SO
HE WAS NOT AS UN@@ MOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUN@@ DRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND AT EM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRIS@@ IS WITH IRE@@ FUL BRAN@@ DISH@@ ING OF AW@@ LS AND VENGE@@ FUL P@@ OUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBEL@@ S WERE UNDER THE HA@@ MMER
TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BA@@ IT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEE@@ BLY EX@@ PRE@@ SSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE@@ P@@ SEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFER@@ IN CRE@@ E@@ TERS NAMES
NO HE AIN'T IT'S A TRA@@ IN@@ ER ADDED AN@@ N LI@@ ZY
NOW C@@ YN@@ THY BE YOU SATISFIED
AND THE IN@@ CONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTT@@ ONY BREAST WEEPING CO@@ PI@@ OUSLY
HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGAR@@ DLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOL@@ VED ABOUT HIM WITH TI@@ RELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLO@@ CKED IN TO APP@@ LAU@@ D ADVISE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOUL@@ DERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRA@@ VELY TRU@@ DGED ON ALONE
THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS
THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STER@@ LING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DA@@ VY ASKED CHRISTI@@ E WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED THERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PEN@@ SION TO SUPPORT YOU
NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTI@@ E
THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUN@@ TS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
DAVID CAUGHT THE EXAL@@ TATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRA@@ VER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMIN@@ ATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRAN@@ GING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BAB@@ Y'S LITTLE CO@@ FFIN
BUT I THINK FEW BRI@@ DES DRESS WITH A BRA@@ VER HAPP@@ IER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTI@@ E SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WO@@ OL@@ LEN STUFF
MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
DAVID AND CHRISTI@@ E WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOY@@ ALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES AD@@ OR@@ NED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAK@@ FA@@ STS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LE@@ TT@@ Y'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DA@@ VI@@ D'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
ALL WATCHED WITH QUICK@@ ENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STE@@ ELY GLIT@@ TER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND AWAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DA@@ UN@@ TLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND E@@ BBED BACK RE@@ DD@@ ENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE

I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE

CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFI@@ DANT
MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESER@@ VING IT
EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMON@@ IES AS THE EXCLU@@ SIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE
MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WA@@ VER@@ LEY'S VISIT TO DON@@ ALD BE@@ AN LEAN
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WA@@ VER@@ LEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRA@@ INED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD IN@@ EXPRES@@ SIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
HE CERTAINLY POSSE@@ SSES TAL@@ ENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MO@@ VES AND BEING NEITHER DEST@@ ITU@@ TE OF AMBITION NOR EN@@ CU@@ MBERED WITH SCRU@@ PLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COM@@ MOTIONS
MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMOR@@ AN@@ DU@@ M OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WA@@ VER@@ LEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DON@@ ALD BE@@ AN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOC@@ ENCE NOR WITH MY WRE@@ T@@ CHE@@ DNESS AND THE PE@@ TRI@@ FYING ACCUR@@ ACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVIL@@ ITY WHILE HE TOR@@ TURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFER@@ ENCES WAS AS TOR@@ MENT@@ ING AS THE RAC@@ KS OF THE IN@@ QUIS@@ ITION
THEY HELD CONVENTI@@ CLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE S@@ COTT@@ ISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE RE@@ IGN@@ S
SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMIN@@ ISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUN@@ TIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
IT HAD NO ORNAM@@ ENT@@ ATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GU@@ ID@@ ES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF T@@ OUR@@ MAL@@ INE WHO IS OUR QUEEN
WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN
EXCLAIMED TRO@@ T OF COURSE
DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESI@@ DEN@@ CES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
THESE INTRU@@ DERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE
SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCH@@ WAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DAR@@ NING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE P@@ INK@@ IES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY T@@ INT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TRO@@ T'S SKIN
WHAT IS IT COR@@ ALI@@ E SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TRO@@ T SEEMED TO APPRO@@ VE BU@@ TTON BRIGH@@ T'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP@@ '@@ N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
ARE YOU A GIANT
PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDI@@ CU@@ LE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAIL@@ OR'S FACE CLOSELY
THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
COR@@ ALI@@ E DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN
EVEN IN AMERICA EVER@@ '@@ BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLU@@ E@@ SKINS ARE SO F@@ RAID O THEIR BOO@@ LO@@ OR@@ O@@ O THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID T@@ OUR@@ MAL@@ INE GRAVELY
THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WEL@@ FARE OF MY SUBJECTS
IN THAT CASE SAID BU@@ TTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
IF I LIVED AS LUXURI@@ OUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND CO@@ STLY GO@@ WNS THE GOOD P@@ INK@@ IES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
NO OUR WAY IS BEST
THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECU@@ TE THE LAWS TO AD@@ JUST GRIEV@@ ANCES AND TO COM@@ PEL ORDER
I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STAT@@ UES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUE@@ ENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE P@@ INK@@ IES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
YES IT WAS WET AN ST@@ ICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AN WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE P@@ INK@@ IES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BOR@@ DERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLU@@ E@@ SKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
THE SAVAGE PHILOSO@@ PHER THE DU@@ AL MIND
THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURR@@ OUNDS AND EMBRAC@@ ES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXAL@@ TED
IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPER@@ FECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASC@@ ENDED TO GOD IN WOR@@ DLESS AD@@ OR@@ ATION
NONE MIGHT EX@@ H@@ ORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY ME@@ DDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
AMONG US ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DI@@ VIN@@ ITY
THAT SOLITARY COMMUN@@ ION WITH THE UN@@ SEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD B@@ AM@@ BE@@ DAY LITER@@ ALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARI@@ OUSLY TRANS@@ LATED FA@@ STING AND DREAMING
THE FIRST B@@ AM@@ BE@@ DAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPO@@ CH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CON@@ FIR@@ MATION OR CONVER@@ SION IN CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE
KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFF@@ ER@@ INGS OR SACRIFIC@@ ES OTHER THAN SYM@@ BO@@ LIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAIN@@ TS AND TOBACCO
AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUN@@ RISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVER@@ LOOKING THE GLOR@@ IES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS AR@@ MING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAP@@ OR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPRO@@ VI@@ DENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
TO THE UN@@ TU@@ TOR@@ ED SAGE THE CONCENTR@@ ATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PRO@@ LI@@ FIC MOTHER OF ALL EV@@ ILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEE@@ CHING OF FAVOR OR HELP
FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCE@@ EDS THE QUICK@@ ENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRU@@ IT@@ FUL WO@@ MB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMB@@ RY@@ OS OF PLANTS AND MEN
THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PRAYER
NOTHING OF THE MARVELOUS COULD ASTON@@ ISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STAND STILL
WHO MAY CON@@ DE@@ MN HIS SUPER@@ ST@@ ITION
HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESS@@ ENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UN@@ LIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSO@@ PHER WHO BE@@ HOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCOR@@ NED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK RE@@ JE@@ CTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURI@@ OUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHI@@ PING DAL@@ LI@@ ANCE OF A RICH NEIGHB@@ OR
THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPU@@ DI@@ ATE HIS OATH
HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANI@@ ZED CHURCH
HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDIT@@ ATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO IN@@ STILL INTO THE RE@@ CEP@@ TIVE SOUL OF THE UN@@ BORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BRO@@ THER@@ HOOD WITH ALL CREATION
THE OR@@ DEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PIT@@ YING EYES EMBAR@@ R@@ ASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FUL@@ FILLING OF LIFE
THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HU@@ MBLY SEE@@ KS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BE@@ ES SP@@ ID@@ ERS BEA@@ VERS AND BAD@@ GERS
IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVER@@ ENTLY OF THE POWERS
INDEED THE DISTIN@@ CTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRAND@@ PARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUA@@ IN@@ TING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRA@@ DITIONS AND BELI@@ EF@@ S
THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UN@@ IT BUT ALSO THE UN@@ IT OF GOVERNMENT
THE REMO@@ TER DEGREES OF KIN@@ SHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITU@@ TED A BIN@@ DING CLAIM AND OUR RIGID MORALITY FOR@@ BADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CL@@ AN
WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER
BEFORE THIS CALAM@@ ITY CAME UPON US YOU COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPP@@ IER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN
HIS DAILY DEVO@@ TIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD
WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRI@@ K@@ INGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDER@@ CLOUD WITH THE RAIN@@ BO@@ W'S GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATER@@ FALL IN THE HEART OF A GREEN GOR@@ GE A VAST PRAIRIE TING@@ ED WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAU@@ SES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP
WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NO@@ TABLE EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE
HE CU@@ TS OFF THE CHO@@ IC@@ EST MOR@@ SEL OF THE MEAT AND CA@@ STS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PU@@ REST AND MOST E@@ THERE@@ AL ELEMENT
THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWA@@ M IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITU@@ TION OF WAR
OUR HONOR IS THE GUARAN@@ TEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MAT@@ ING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRI@@ ALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
THIS B@@ OND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
RE@@ IN@@ CAR@@ NATION AND THE CON@@ VERSE OF SPIRITS
THEREFORE HE COUR@@ TS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DIS@@ GRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
THE MEN BL@@ AC@@ KEN THEIR FACES AND WI@@ DOWS OR BER@@ EA@@ VED PARENTS SOMETIMES G@@ ASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
GIVING THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COM@@ ERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME
IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSE@@ SSIONS AND ORNAM@@ ENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROB@@ ES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF RA@@ W HIDE
AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEE@@ PE@@ E WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMP@@ LEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UN@@ DA@@ UNTED DEFI@@ ANCE AND BRA@@ VERY EVEN IN DEATH
AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PAR@@ TAKE OF THE FOOD
AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTER@@ RED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMON@@ IES
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OC@@ CUL@@ T POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IM@@ PO@@ STORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL AT@@ TE@@ STED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHE@@ CIES AND OTHER MY@@ STIC PRACTICE
NO DOUBT MANY PREDI@@ CTIONS HAVE BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UN@@ QUESTI@@ ONABLY FALSE PROPHE@@ TS FA@@ K@@ IRS AND CON@@ JUR@@ ERS HAVE BECOME THE PEST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANS@@ ITION PERIOD
THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHE@@ CIES
ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RU@@ M RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCE@@ STRA@@ L ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL S@@ LAUGHTER
THERE ARE MANY TRU@@ ST@@ WORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO V@@ OU@@ CH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCUR@@ RING AS FORE@@ TOLD
AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELL@@ IS ON THE AS@@ SIN@@ I@@ BO@@ INE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELE@@ CTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP
MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER IN@@ CAR@@ NATION
THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SI@@ OU@@ X WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND
SHI@@ LO@@ H
THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRI@@ EKS AND GRO@@ ANS OF BRILLIANT CHAR@@ GES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA
ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHAL@@ MERS BRI@@ GA@@ DE RELIEVED GLA@@ DD@@ EN'S
AS GLA@@ DDEN RODE BY US A COU@@ RI@@ ER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
WE WERE SUPPOR@@ TING AN AL@@ AB@@ AM@@ A BRI@@ GA@@ DE
THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TEN@@ NE@@ S@@ SEE GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA
THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATT@@ LE@@ FIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATT@@ LE@@ FIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAG@@ ONS ALL JU@@ MBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STRE@@ WN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE PO@@ MP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
OFFICERS COULD NOT CUR@@ B THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE
ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVER@@ SED
BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTO@@ MAT@@ ON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENER@@ ALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRON@@ IC@@ LES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I RE@@ FER YOU TO HISTORY
ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRA@@ Y BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLO@@ PED OFF DRAG@@ GING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDER@@ ATE LINES
ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED ME A MULE
HE WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCE@@ IT
I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SP@@ LIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO
MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWI@@ STER ON HIS NOSE
SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MU@@ LE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CA@@ IS@@ SON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MU@@ LE'S NO AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LE@@ E@@ TLE TOO SMART
WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
THE FEDER@@ AL ARMY WAS CONCENTR@@ ATING AT N@@ ASH@@ VILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MUR@@ FRE@@ ES@@ BORO
FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGI@@ MENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PIC@@ KET DUTY
THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ E PIC@@ KET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
I AM A VI@@ DE@@ T YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SE@@ CE@@ SH ON HIS WORD OATH OR B@@ OND MARCH I SAY
I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRA@@ BBED AT MY GUN
HE DIV@@ INED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF ST@@ ONE'S RIVER ON THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ E SIDE
BAD GENER@@ AL@@ SHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRI@@ ER@@ SON'S ATTENTION TO THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ ES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ ES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK
THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ ES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ E LINE ON THE WIL@@ KER@@ SON TUR@@ N@@ PI@@ KE
WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ ES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YEL@@ LING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
OA@@ K@@ LEY COLOR BE@@ ARER OF THE FOURTH TEN@@ NE@@ S@@ SEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ E LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEG@@ GING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
THE LEAD@@ EN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRI@@ GA@@ DE CHE@@ ATH@@ AM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVER@@ TOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ ES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
ADVANCE INTO TEN@@ NE@@ S@@ SEE
Y@@ AN@@ K SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY
WE PASSED AROUND ATLAN@@ TA CROSSED THE CHA@@ T@@ TA@@ HOO@@ CHEE AND TRAVEL@@ ED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE AR@@ DU@@ OUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHN@@ STON
OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL RE@@ MIN@@ DERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DE@@ SOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INV@@ ADING ARMY
WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RA@@ MP@@ ARTS AND THOUGHT THAT Y@@ AN@@ K WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LI@@ CE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HEL@@ LO BOYS WHAT IS IT BO@@ SS
A Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ E ALWAYS SAYS N@@ AG@@ ER
THEY PERSUADED ELOQU@@ ENTLY
A MAN IN THE WELL
THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UN@@ SOL@@ VED PROBLEM
THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TEN@@ NE@@ S@@ SEE SIDE OF TEN@@ NE@@ S@@ SEE RIVER
WE HAD BE@@ EF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THRO@@ B WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY A@@ KIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
WE WERE IN@@ URED TO PRIV@@ ATIONS AND HARD@@ SHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIR@@ MISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
BUT AFTER A@@ WHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY G@@ ANN@@ Y THE LAW
YOU SEE JIM KNO@@ WED THE LAW
THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREAS@@ URED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE Y@@ AN@@ KE@@ ES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MUR@@ FRE@@ ES@@ BORO PI@@ KE
A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM@@ 'S REGIMENT
HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLA@@ ZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYN@@ ON@@ Y@@ M OF JOY
SUCH PERFECT COMPLE@@ TENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJE@@ CTED TO TRANS@@ MU@@ TATION WHY NOT
ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDU@@ STRIOUS MANI@@ PU@@ LAT@@ ORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OC@@ CUL@@ T SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SUR@@ GER@@ Y WHAT AL@@ CHE@@ MY WAS TO CHE@@ MI@@ STRY HAD CHI@@ SEL@@ LED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFAC@@ TURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PRE@@ ME@@ D@@ ITATION
GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUN@@ TE@@ BANK
HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
IT WAS GWYNPLA@@ INE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RI@@ CT@@ US
ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUG@@ MENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRE@@ CTLY AG@@ GRAV@@ ATED IT
AN EVERLASTING LAUGH
THE MAN@@ IC@@ HA@@ E@@ ANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES AB@@ DI@@ C@@ ATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMB@@ LES A LETTER MODI@@ FIED IN THE POST@@ SCRIPT
WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLA@@ INE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING
THE JOYOUS CONVUL@@ SION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHAN@@ ICALLY
BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATI@@ ENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUP@@ PRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED AN@@ A@@ ES@@ THE@@ SIA
BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A G@@ Y@@ M@@ NA@@ ST AND AN ATH@@ LE@@ TE
GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR
HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN D@@ YED WITH SOME COR@@ RO@@ SIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOO@@ LLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
ITS YELLOW BRI@@ STLES RATHER A MAN@@ E THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRI@@ VED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RI@@ P@@ ENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO RE@@ MOR@@ SE
WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING
FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
THIS GREEN COL@@ OUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
ON THE ROOF FROM A TU@@ BE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLA@@ GERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHEL@@ MING
THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF UR@@ SUS ITS PROPOR@@ TIONS AUG@@ MENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOO@@ TH INTO A THEATRE
UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT
THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJE@@ CTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FE@@ TES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED UR@@ SUS WHO WAS THE ADMINI@@ STR@@ ATOR OF GWYNPLA@@ INE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHAR@@ I@@ OT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRU@@ CTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAV@@ AN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SO@@ W SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGH@@ WAYS
FOR THESE READ FI@@ B@@ I AND VIN@@ OS THAT WE MAY CON@@ FORM TO ENGLISH PRON@@ UN@@ CI@@ ATION
PHO@@ E@@ BE COO@@ KED VENUS SCRU@@ BBED THE TEMPLE
UR@@ SUS AND HO@@ MO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BED@@ CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO UR@@ SUS AND GWYNPLAINE
THE CARAV@@ AN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMP@@ ART@@ MENTS PART@@ ITI@@ ONED FROM EACH OTHER
A LO@@ FT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
UR@@ SUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGI@@ CAL REPRESENT@@ ATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE IT@@ IN@@ ER@@ ANT PURIT@@ AN PRE@@ ACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
UR@@ SUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE OR@@ CHE@@ STR@@ A
IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTH@@ WAR@@ K
THE DO@@ ME OF SAINT PA@@ UL@@ 'S WAS A DELIGHT TO UR@@ SUS
SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTEN@@ U@@ ATING CIRCUMSTANCES
HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTI@@ STS DOOR
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX
IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE
AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
THE PLAC@@ ARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NA@@ IL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRU@@ CTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FI@@ B@@ I AND SOMETIMES VIN@@ OS
WE ARE IN LONDON SAID UR@@ SUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENT@@ RY
THEY BEGAN THEIR PER@@ FOR@@ MAN@@ CES
WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUN@@ TE@@ BANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PAR@@ ALLE@@ L
ALL SOUTH@@ WAR@@ K RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN
THE MERRY ANDRE@@ WS AND MOUN@@ TE@@ BANKS OF TAR@@ R@@ IN@@ Z@@ EAU FIELD WERE AG@@ HAST AT GWYNPLAINE
GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC
BESIDES THE SMALL F@@ RY THE SW@@ AL@@ LOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRI@@ MACE MA@@ KERS REAL PER@@ FOR@@ MAN@@ CES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
EVEN THIS CO@@ MEDI@@ AN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS E@@ CLI@@ P@@ SED IN SUCCESS
THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODI@@ GI@@ OUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHA@@ KE@@ SPE@@ ARE TO PENETR@@ ATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
THESE WERE REMARKABLE TAL@@ ENTS
BESIDES THIS HE HAR@@ ANGU@@ ED LIKE C@@ IC@@ ER@@ O AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRU@@ GS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HE@@ ALED THE SICK
UR@@ SUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTH@@ WAR@@ K BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANS@@ FORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
THE EMP@@ T@@ YING OF TAN@@ K@@ ARDS DID NOT DECRE@@ ASE THEIR SUCCESS
THIS CON@@ NOIS@@ SE@@ UR WAS SUDDENLY FASCIN@@ ATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO AC@@ CLA@@ MATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTER@@ PIECE OF UR@@ SUS
HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED UR@@ SUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
ONE EVENING UR@@ SUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NIC@@ LESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SC@@ OUN@@ DRE@@ L
AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME RE@@ ELING DRUN@@ K@@ ARD MAKING STAGG@@ ERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CAR@@ GO OF LU@@ GG@@ AGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VAL@@ K@@ Y@@ RI@@ E
BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MO@@ O@@ DY AND DIS@@ SATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAM@@ LET
BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DEN@@ MARK
NO MISTER HARD@@ WIG@@ G SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
ON THE ELEV@@ ENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE POR@@ TLAND OVER WHICH TO@@ W@@ ERED MOUNT MY@@ R@@ DALS YO@@ KU@@ L WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
THE VAL@@ K@@ Y@@ RI@@ E KEPT OFF THE COAST STE@@ ERING TO THE WEST@@ WARD
ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHA@@ LES AND SHAR@@ KS
NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERI@@ O@@ DI@@ CAL VESSEL
THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FRO@@ WNED DAR@@ KLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON TRA@@ MP@@ E
THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
THIS MODEST SCHO@@ LAR SPOKE NO LANGU@@ AGES SAVE IC@@ EL@@ AN@@ DI@@ C AND LATIN
WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HOR@@ ACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AN GOES WELL THE WORSE DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANU@@ SCRIP@@ TS FROM THE HAND OF SA@@ K@@ NU@@ S@@ SEM@@ M
I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSUL@@ T THEM
THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TI@@ LES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNO@@ Y@@ ANCE OF THE PA@@ ST@@ OR AND CONGREG@@ ATION
THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESI@@ DEN@@ CES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCUR@@ SION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DR@@ YING SAL@@ TING AND LO@@ ADING CO@@ D@@ FISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EX@@ POR@@ TATION
THE MEN APPEARED RO@@ BU@@ ST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PEN@@ SIVE MI@@ EN EX@@ IL@@ ES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LADDER OF HUMANITY THAN THE E@@ SKI@@ MO@@ S BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PER@@ CEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE PO@@ LAR CIRCLE
I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EX@@ HI@@ LAR@@ ATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATI@@ FICATION AND LIBERTY
HAN@@ S OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UN@@ VAR@@ YING STEP
OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LU@@ GG@@ AGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT RE@@ QUIR@@ ING WHIP OR SP@@ UR
GEO@@ GRA@@ PH@@ ERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTH@@ WEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VER@@ N@@ AC@@ U@@ LAR IS CALLED SU@@ D@@ VE@@ ST@@ R F@@ JOR@@ DUN@@ G@@ R
WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPAR@@ SE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOO@@ TED CENT@@ AU@@ R
SNOW TEMPEST IMP@@ RAC@@ TI@@ CABLE ROADS ROCKS IC@@ E@@ BER@@ GS NOTHING ST@@ OPS HIM
WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRA@@ MP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE
MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOL@@ ATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BU@@ R OR IC@@ EL@@ AN@@ DI@@ C HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LA@@ VA LOOKING LIKE BEG@@ G@@ ARS ON THE HIGH@@ WAY OF LIFE
A FEW STRA@@ Y COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PEN@@ INSUL@@ A OF SNE@@ FF@@ ELS WHERE AG@@ GLO@@ MER@@ ATIONS OF NATU@@ RE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHA@@ OS
IT CONSI@@ STS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAM@@ LET
I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSUL@@ T THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GAR@@ DAR WAS TO BE FOUND
THESE SACRED EDI@@ FIC@@ ES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WAT@@ CHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS
BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT
AT LENGTH THE ST@@ UR@@ DY LITTLE PONY SPRE@@ ADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LU@@ DI@@ CR@@ OUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFE@@ SS@@ OR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOS@@ SUS OF R@@ HO@@ DES
HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANS@@ LATING THE DAN@@ ISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECI@@ ATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE F@@ JOR@@ D FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF S@@ LACK WATER
ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FER@@ RY BOATS OF THE EL@@ BE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BO@@ AT@@ MEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LO@@ CO@@ MOTION
BUT THIS POWER OF DISCER@@ N@@ MENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRE@@ SIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON W@@ AB@@ I@@ GO@@ ON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE AB@@ DU@@ CTION OF THE PRINCESS
WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WO@@ ONG@@ A AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
THREE DAYS LATER MIN@@ NE@@ TA@@ KI BECAME NEW@@ SOME@@ 'S WIFE AT THE HU@@ D@@ SON BAY POST
FROM THAT HOUR D@@ ATED ONE OF THE MOST SAN@@ GU@@ IN@@ ARY FE@@ U@@ DS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRA@@ DING COMPANY A FE@@ U@@ D WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEW@@ SOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEW@@ SOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MIN@@ NE@@ TA@@ KI
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF W@@ AB@@ I RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FORE@@ FATHERS WHILE MIN@@ NE@@ TA@@ KI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOF@@ TER LO@@ VEL@@ INESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT J@@ ET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRA@@ STING WITH THE LIGH@@ TER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
W@@ AB@@ I ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MO@@ C@@ CAS@@ INS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD S@@ WAR@@ THY SIN@@ E@@ WY AS AG@@ ILE AS A LYN@@ X AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
ONE OF NEW@@ SOME@@ 'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDU@@ C@@ ATING OF HIS WOOD@@ LAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MIN@@ NE@@ TA@@ KI AND HER BROTHER BE RE@@ ARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FAC@@ TOR@@ 'S SCHOOL AND TWO WIN@@ TERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME W@@ AB@@ I WAS SIXTEEN AND MIN@@ NE@@ TA@@ KI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WO@@ ONG@@ AS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DE@@ PRE@@ DATIONS
AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVIN@@ CIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTOR@@ IOUS FOLLOWERS
BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LON@@ EL@@ INESS AND HIS LONG@@ INGS FOR MIN@@ NE@@ TA@@ KI AND HIS FORESTS
NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PIC@@ TURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND W@@ AB@@ I WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MIN@@ NE@@ TA@@ KI AND TO HIS FORESTS
THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOYS EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER
WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EAR@@ N IN DE@@ TRO@@ IT IN THREE YEARS
WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUN@@ TY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCAL@@ P TAKEN
THREE WEEKS LATER CAME W@@ AB@@ I@@ GO@@ ON'S REPLY
ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET RO@@ D AT SPRU@@ CE@@ WOOD ON THE BLACK ST@@ UR@@ GEON RIVER
THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEI@@ PT OF W@@ AB@@ I@@ 'S LETTER FOUND RO@@ D AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIR@@ L THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOME@@ COMING
COLONEL LE@@ ON@@ ID@@ AS TAL@@ BO@@ T REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT AND THE SHORE
THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS E@@ TCHED SHARPLY IN THE DA@@ ZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUM@@ TER IS OURS
BUT THE NE@@ GO@@ TI@@ ATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
ALL THE AM@@ EN@@ ITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GAR@@ RISON AND THEIR CAP@@ TORS
THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESI@@ DENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROL@@ INA TEN@@ NE@@ S@@ SEE AND AR@@ KAN@@ S@@ AS FOLLOWED HER BUT MAR@@ Y@@ LAND K@@ ENT@@ U@@ CKY AND MIS@@ SOUR@@ I STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOL@@ UN@@ TE@@ ERS TO PUT DOWN A REBEL@@ LION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHAR@@ LE@@ STON THAT THE CONFEDER@@ ACY WAS NOW SECURE
THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DA@@ V@@ IS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FO@@ E WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOY@@ ALTY
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM
EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT
BEAU@@ REGARD AT ONCE WROTE AN ORDER
COLONEL K@@ ENT@@ ON WRITES WIS@@ ELY
WE NEED K@@ ENT@@ U@@ CKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DELA@@ UN@@ A@@ Y'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAG@@ GAGE
HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
HARRY GAVE HIS FARE@@ WEL@@ LS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRI@@ VOL@@ OUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCER@@ ELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL
FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSI@@ BILITIES AND PER@@ ILS
BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHAR@@ LE@@ STON THE GAY THE VOL@@ ATI@@ LE AND THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY
HE SOON LEFT CHAR@@ LE@@ STON OUT OF SIGHT
HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
PEOPLE WERE COOL@@ ER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PR@@ ONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
THE AIR TOO WAS UN@@ LIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROL@@ INA THERE WAS A SHAR@@ PER TAN@@ G TO IT
IT WHI@@ PPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRE@@ STS
IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WIN@@ TON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL ST@@ UR@@ DY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AG@@ ILITY
THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD K@@ ENT@@ U@@ CKY
BILL SK@@ EL@@ LY AN HIS GAN@@ G THEM MOUNTAINE@@ ERS ARE UP
HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSUR@@ ANCE TO THE LI@@ VER@@ YMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
IF YOU'VE GOT PISTO@@ LS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS
HARRY THANKED HIM THREW HIS SADDLE BAG@@ S ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LI@@ VER@@ YMAN RODE AWAY
THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TW@@ INKLED
ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMI@@ THY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOL@@ IN SET OUT FOR TE@@ ST@@ BRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
WAS THERE EVER A HAPP@@ IER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRO@@ DE ALONG THE FOOT@@ PATH
HE PRESSED HIS VIOL@@ IN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ALL
BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THERE THEN
WHEN HE REACHED THE SUB@@ UR@@ BS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CUR@@ TAINS OF ALL COLORS
JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SOR@@ ROWS
THE NE@@ TTLE AND THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH
HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT
HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOL@@ IN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
LET@@ TY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMER@@ GEN@@ CY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TI@@ RE@@ SOME VISITOR
THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOL@@ IN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
LET@@ TY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GAR@@ MENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HA@@ UNT THE WORLD
IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERN@@ ITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSI@@ CIAN
I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOL@@ IN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTRE@@ ATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF A PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
WHEN THOU LO@@ VE@@ ST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YE@@ A OR EVEN DOG ARI@@ GHT THEN WIL@@ T THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLOR@@ IES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
HE THAT LO@@ VE@@ TH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL HE LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN
A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MAR@@ Y'S BOSOM
THAT ENCHAN@@ T@@ MENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USUR@@ PING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DIS@@ PLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOL@@ IN WITH A CR@@ ASH AGAINST THE PIANO THEN SOMEHOW STU@@ MBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
IN THE ACT OF RECO@@ VERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TE@@ ARING DIS@@ COR@@ DANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
HIS VIOL@@ IN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE
LOOKS LIKE A CLU@@ MP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT
YES AGREED TA@@ D THAT DOES LOOK LIKE BUSHES
DON'T MOVE AROUND LIE PERFECTLY STILL WARNED THE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT
AND THAT TU@@ MB@@ LE'S ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SENSE OUT OF A FULL GROWN MAN
I COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHAR@@ GES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK AND
NO I AM THE LIGH@@ TER OF THE TWO URGED TA@@ D
I AM THE ONE TO GO AFTER WAL@@ T IF ANYONE HAS TO I'LL GO DOWN MISTER THOMAS
MASTER TA@@ D IS RIGHT DECIDED THE GUIDE GAZING AT THE TWO BOYS APPRO@@ V@@ INGLY
I PROTEST SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR

BE SURE TO FA@@ STEN HIM SECU@@ RELY TO THE LOO@@ P BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HAU@@ L UP WARNED THE GUIDE
ARE YOU READY YES
HE TIL@@ TED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP
THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWA@@ YING GI@@ D@@ DILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCKS TO STEADY HIMSELF TA@@ D WIS@@ ELY CONCLUDED THAT HERE@@ AFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS
SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TEN@@ SE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CAN@@ YOU
AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS
LI@@ GE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE
I SEE HIM CALLED TA@@ D HIS VOICE S@@ OUNDING HOLLOW AND UN@@ NATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
HE'S SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM
LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PIN@@ YON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME
LI@@ GE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN AR@@ C OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TOR@@ CH IN TA@@ D'S HAND
BUT FROM THE CAUTI@@ OUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
ME@@ BBY YOU THINK HE'S HAVING SOME SORT OF A PIC@@ NI@@ C DOWN THERE EH GL@@ ARED LI@@ GE
SHALL WE HAU@@ L UP ASKED LI@@ GE MAKING A ME@@ G@@ AP@@ H@@ ONE OF HIS HANDS YES HAU@@ L AWAY
SURE THING ANSWERED THE BOY
NOR WAS HIS SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHI@@ FTING HIS POSITION THE TOR@@ CH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE F@@ AG@@ OTS SCAT@@ TERING AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIR@@ LING IN EVER DIMIN@@ ISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM CL@@ AT@@ TER ON THE ROCKS BELOW
HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED P@@ ELL M@@ ELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BUR@@ RO@@ S URGED THEM ON WITH DER@@ IS@@ I@@ VE SHOU@@ TS AND SUN@@ DRY RES@@ OUNDING SLA@@ PS ON THE ANIMALS FLAN@@ KS
COLD WATER IS THE MOST NOUR@@ ISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT
WE DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TA@@ D
AND WE'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU ANNOUNCED ST@@ ACY SW@@ ELLING WITH PRIDE
J@@ AM EXCLAIMED CH@@ UN@@ KY STRETCHING HIS NECK AND EYE@@ ING THE DISH LONG@@ INGLY
NOW FALL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN DIRECTED THE PROFESSOR
I AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO
HE BURIED HIS BISCU@@ IT UNDER A LA@@ YER OF J@@ AM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK CO@@ ATING OF HONEY
PRESIDENT BROWN I WITH@@ DRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APO@@ LOGI@@ ES
I RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW
YES THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF CA@@ VES
THIS ANNOUN@@ CEMENT FILLED THE BOYS WITH EXCITEMENT
BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETT@@ LER WHO WILL L@@ END US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT
SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHA@@ T AFTER WHICH AD@@ MON@@ ISHING ST@@ ACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BOR@@ ROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PON@@ IES OWING TO THE RU@@ GGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOUR@@ NE@@ YING
THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PON@@ IES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OW@@ NERS
THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOO@@ TED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A S@@ LACK ROPE
AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORE@@ NOON
A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PON@@ IES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LEN@@ G@@ THS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT P@@ LOT OF GREEN
ALL AGREED THAT TA@@ D'S SUPERIOR HORSE@@ MAN@@ SHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM
GALLO@@ PING INTO CAMP THE BOY FE@@ TCHED HIS SO@@ MB@@ R@@ ER@@ O WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY
THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RO@@ DS AND WHEEL@@ ING SPUR@@ RED HIS PONY TO A RUN
GRAS@@ PING THE PO@@ M@@ MEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DI@@ VE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND
THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TA@@ D BUT@@ LER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIR@@ RU@@ PS UTTERING A COW@@ BOY Y@@ ELL AS HE WAVED THE SO@@ MB@@ R@@ ER@@ O ON HIGH
THE BOYS HO@@ WLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE ST@@ ACY BROWN
TA@@ D IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER
THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE PO@@ M@@ MEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDER@@ INGLY
HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CH@@ UN@@ KY THE BOYS RO@@ ARED
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY
ONCE MORE ST@@ ACY APPROACHED THE SO@@ MB@@ R@@ ER@@ O HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TA@@ D BUT@@ LER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FRE@@ ED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIR@@ RU@@ P HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRE@@ CAUTION TO GRASP THE PO@@ M@@ MEL
AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT
NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY
A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CH@@ UN@@ K@@ Y'S EXPENSE
THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT
WAL@@ TER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR NIGH@@ TLY STORY TELLING
NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW
WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FI@@ DDLE
HU@@ MP@@ H GR@@ UNTED CUR@@ LEY ADAMS
THE COW@@ BOY DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLAN@@ KETS HAD BEEN AS@@ SIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TAR@@ PA@@ UL@@ IN
THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PIL@@ LOWS
ST@@ ACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRU@@ MB@@ LER IN THE LOT DECL@@ ARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WIN@@ K ON SUCH A BED AS THAT
THE HORSES OF THE OUT@@ FIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRA@@ YING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STA@@ KED DOWN
IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COU@@ CHES THE PONY RI@@ DERS SLEPT S@@ OUN@@ DLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZE@@ PP@@ LIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
ST@@ ACY GRU@@ MBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COW@@ BOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
LU@@ MP@@ Y BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
H@@ I THERE HI@@ SSED LU@@ MP@@ Y FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
ST@@ ACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE
WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY
KEEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLU@@ MB INTO THEM WAS THE JE@@ ERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEP@@ Y COW@@ MEN SPUR@@ RED THEIR PON@@ IES ON TOWARD CAMP MU@@ TTERING THEIR DISAPPRO@@ VAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHO@@ ES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRI@@ LL VOICE PI@@ PED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON
GRU@@ B P@@ I LE GRU@@ B P@@ I LE
WHO IS THE W@@ RAN@@ GL@@ ER THIS MORNING ASKED THE FORE@@ MAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN
A W@@ RAN@@ GL@@ ER'S A W@@ RAN@@ GL@@ ER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STO@@ LI@@ DLY
HE'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL THE TIME MAKING TROUBLE ISN'T HE ASKED ST@@ ACY INNOC@@ ENTLY
OH NO THIS KIND OF A W@@ RAN@@ GL@@ ER ISN'T LAUGHED THE FORE@@ MAN
HE'S A TROUBLE CUR@@ ER NOT A TROU@@ BLE@@ MAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF
P@@ ONG TELL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE BAD ME@@ ALS TO THIS OUT@@ FIT OF COW@@ PUN@@ CH@@ ERS
HOW ASKED TA@@ D
WE HAD BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING
WHAT A FU@@ SS IS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CON@@ VOL@@ V@@ U@@ LU@@ S WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE PO@@ TS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WOR@@ MS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TU@@ FTS TO LUXURI@@ ATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDEN@@ ER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERI@@ ORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FRO@@ LIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STE@@ M BEING PRO@@ PPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
HE REALLY GRI@@ EVED TO SEE IT
DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MIS@@ CHIEV@@ OUS SUGGESTIONS
ECHOED THE FLOWERS TRE@@ MUL@@ OUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
MAKING A SORT OF E@@ DD@@ YING CIRCU@@ IT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CON@@ VOL@@ V@@ U@@ LU@@ S POLE TORE THE STRI@@ PS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOO@@ SED ALL THE CAR@@ NATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FA@@ ST@@ ENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LE@@ VEL@@ LED THE SWEET PE@@ AS TO THE GROUND
MEANWHILE HOW F@@ ARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY F@@ IR POLE
THE HONE@@ Y@@ SU@@ CKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CAR@@ NATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER CO@@ VE@@ TED FREEDOM HAD LE@@ VEL@@ LED HER TO THE DIR@@ T
BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDEN@@ ER CAME WHIST@@ LING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHAR@@ GES
BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
WE@@ EDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DRE@@ ARY CONFUSION REIG@@ NED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PL@@ ANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AF@@ RE@@ SH
IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DE@@ U@@ CAL@@ ION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PRO@@ ME@@ THE@@ US
AFTER J@@ UP@@ IT@@ ER HAD BOUND PRO@@ ME@@ THE@@ US ON MOUNT CAU@@ CAS@@ US AND HAD SENT DIS@@ EAS@@ ES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND RO@@ BBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
NO ONE BUT DE@@ U@@ CAL@@ ION THE SON OF PRO@@ ME@@ THE@@ US WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
THE DAY IS COMING SAID PRO@@ ME@@ THE@@ US WHEN J@@ UP@@ IT@@ ER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
BUT DE@@ U@@ CAL@@ ION AND P@@ YR@@ R@@ HA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DE@@ U@@ CAL@@ ION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MER@@ CUR@@ Y AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED P@@ YR@@ R@@ HA
SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DE@@ U@@ CAL@@ ION
WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVER@@ JO@@ YED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRIST@@ ENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
ONE OF THE YOUNG FAI@@ RIES OVER@@ HEARING HER AND F@@ ANC@@ YING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HAN@@ G@@ INGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UN@@ DO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MAL@@ ICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIER@@ CE HER HAND WITH A SPIN@@ DLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UN@@ DO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPIN@@ NING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDI@@ CT
SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPIN@@ DLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FA@@ INTED AWAY
HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHAN@@ TED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WIT@@ CHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT O@@ GR@@ E WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THOR@@ NS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMP@@ ENE@@ TRA@@ BLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
HE ENTERED A LARGE FORE@@ COURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GO@@ BLE@@ TS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CAR@@ B@@ INES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU
THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN WA@@ KENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLEN@@ DOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
THE VIOL@@ INS AND HAU@@ T BOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND AL@@ MON@@ ER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHA@@ PEL OF THE CASTLE
HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BE@@ EN@@ I@@ E AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PA@@ RENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STA@@ IR AND THROUGH THE NAR@@ ROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RA@@ VED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BAL@@ ES BAN@@ KED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CH@@ INK OF ENTRANCE
WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BE@@ EN@@ I@@ E UN@@ DESIRED HAD KIN@@ DLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UN@@ NATURAL UN@@ CAN@@ NY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEAR@@ TH AND IN SAD DRE@@ A@@ MY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HO@@ WLING SWO@@ OPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUI@@ VER AND SHAKE
THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND OD@@ ORS
BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TO@@ MBS
SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOO@@ TED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTOR@@ ING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HE@@ EDED HER
SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NO@@ WHERE TO GO NO@@ WHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING
I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WAKING
THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICK@@ ER DREAM AND THIS IS TRU@@ ER BECAUSE MORE SHADO@@ WY
HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A FU@@ ME FROM MY OWN BRAIN
THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAP@@ TIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
WITH THAT CAME A PAN@@ G OF INTENSE PAIN
SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PO@@ EM A LY@@ RIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCAR@@ F COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOS@@ SO@@ MED BOUGHS
HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLU@@ E@@ BELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAID@@ ENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TR@@ Y@@ ST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD PO@@ ETS AND OF THE CHE@@ AP@@ ER WEE@@ KLY JOUR@@ N@@ ALS
SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING AND HER EN@@ VIR@@ ONMENT THE LITER@@ ARY SENSE
AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE D@@ ING@@ Y DU@@ STY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PRE@@ OCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT
IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMB@@ ANK@@ MENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAIL@@ WAY CARRIAGE
HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD
SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR
SHE SAID HOW FRIGH@@ TFULLY COLD IT IS
AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
A SHOCK OF UN@@ BELI@@ EV@@ ABLE RELIEF TING@@ LED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PUR@@ ITY OF HER MIND THE INNOC@@ ENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
FOLLOWING THE TING@@ LE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICK@@ ENING PIN@@ CH OF JEALOUSY AND MOR@@ TI@@ FICATION THESE INSPIR@@ ED HER
I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDI@@ OT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW
NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLO@@ AT OVER IT ALL
HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
AND HE STRO@@ DE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SW@@ ING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EX@@ IT
AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR
HE CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE
SO HE ENLI@@ STED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH ME@@ DALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND RE@@ PAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
THE LAST STRA@@ INS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL F@@ ATED INTER@@ ME@@ ZZ@@ O HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RU@@ MBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDER@@ OUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUN@@ ES OF ITS RE@@ PER@@ TORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSE@@ MAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CRO@@ WING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WA@@ X CAN@@ DLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CAN@@ D@@ LE@@ STICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TOR@@ TURE
THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRA@@ VEL
AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE
NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE
THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAU@@ REL BUSHES
LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER
HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXC@@ ITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
HER LITTLE FOOT TA@@ PPED THE GRA@@ VEL IMPATIENTLY
HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TR@@ UNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT
SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND
WELL THEN I WENT INTO LO@@ D@@ G@@ INGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE
LET ME THINK HE SAID OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LAT@@ CH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
YOU SEE PAP@@ A'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DU@@ KES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED
ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRE@@ LE@@ VAN@@ TLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LAT@@ CH KEY
YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
THE LADY AND THE GU@@ IT@@ AR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VIL@@ LA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHAR@@ WOMAN
THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BAN@@ JO GIRL HAS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCK@@ LES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE
IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CA@@ STAN@@ ET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CRED@@ ITING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UN@@ PLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONE@@ STY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS

THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POST@@ URING
THE FAMOUS TER@@ R@@ ORI@@ ST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDI@@ FICE
THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RU@@ BB@@ ISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME

ST@@ EV@@ I@@ E ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DIS@@ REGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TER@@ R@@ ORI@@ ST AS IF ROO@@ TED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MOR@@ BID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN

ST@@ EV@@ I@@ E SWALLOWED THE TERRI@@ FYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GUL@@ P AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LI@@ MP@@ LY IN A SITTING POST@@ URE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRA@@ INED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHOT THE BOL@@ T

LO@@ AF@@ ING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER V@@ LA@@ DI@@ M@@ IR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
THESE WERE BUT FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED HIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVE@@ Y OF ITS VALUE
THIS SURVE@@ Y WAS UN@@ FAVOURABLE
HE TOOK THE C@@ ASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT ST@@ EV@@ I@@ E WAS STILL DOWN@@ STAIRS
HE LOOKED DU@@ BI@@ OUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
MISTER VER@@ LO@@ C PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO ST@@ EV@@ I@@ E
HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
HE WATCHED HIM GE@@ STIC@@ U@@ LATING AND MURMUR@@ ING IN THE KITCHEN

THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UN@@ INHABITED AND THIR@@ STY PLAIN
THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VER@@ LO@@ C BECAUSE HE HAD SAT A@@ STRI@@ DE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCI@@ PI@@ ENT FALL
THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW P@@ ANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD
YES NOT AT ALL WELL
DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEAS@@ URED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UN@@ HURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PAS@@ SER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERN@@ ITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DRO@@ WSY TI@@ CKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM
THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TI@@ CKS OF THE CLOCK
THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT ST@@ EV@@ I@@ E HAD DIS@@ REGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DO@@ CI@@ LE THAN STEPHEN SHE AF@@ FIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTION@@ ATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UP@@ SET HIS POOR HEAD
MISTER VER@@ LO@@ C@@ 'S ANX@@ I@@ ETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATT@@ ACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
THAT BOY HE@@ ARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVER@@ HEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
MISTER VER@@ LO@@ C WAS FULLY RESPON@@ SIVE NOW
ASK KAR@@ L Y@@ UN@@ D@@ T HE GROW@@ LED SAV@@ AG@@ ELY
HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELI@@ EVES IT'S ALL TRUE
HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT
HE GL@@ ARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWN@@ STAIRS
I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS VER@@ LO@@ C BEGAN AGAIN BRU@@ SQU@@ ELY
HE GETS A RED FACE POR@@ ING OVER THEM
I WOULDN'T GIVE A HAL@@ F@@ PEN@@ NY FOR THE WHOLE LOT
THE OTHER DAY ST@@ EV@@ I@@ E GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TE@@ ARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RE@@ CRU@@ IT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE
HE CAN'T STAND THE NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY
COMFORTABLE DEAR
THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF H@@ ON THOMAS L HA@@ MER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EV@@ IN@@ CED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY T@@ ACTI@@ CS
GRANT ACTED AS MU@@ STERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSI@@ ONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST IL@@ LIN@@ O@@ IS VOL@@ UN@@ TE@@ ERS HE TOOK THE FIELD
GENERAL HAL@@ LE@@ CK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID
INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NA@@ VIG@@ ATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS
HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDER@@ AL FORCES
THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDER@@ ATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTU@@ ALLY ENDING THE WAR
WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUT@@ GROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTI@@ VE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE
SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WR@@ OUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIR@@ DI@@ KINS
INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RU@@ FFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD
SHE PO@@ PPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PE@@ ERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW S@@ LIT@@ S WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HO@@ PPING ABOUT AND TWIT@@ TERING HEL@@ PLE@@ SSLY
THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIR@@ PED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US
SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HO@@ PPING TWIT@@ TERING UP TO THE EL@@ M TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NE@@ STLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NE@@ STS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEP@@ Y
THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DI@@ LIG@@ ENT OBE@@ DIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
AND WHERE EACH BIRD PER@@ CHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEA@@ VE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NE@@ STS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCRE@@ AMED THE JACK@@ DA@@ W
HERE WOOD PI@@ GEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRIS@@ S CROSS CRIS@@ S CROSS SO
CRIS@@ S CROSS CRIS@@ S CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PI@@ GEON
YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NE@@ STS BY YOURSELVES
MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE
AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN CO@@ SY NEST IN THE EL@@ M TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
BUT THE WOOD PI@@ GEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRIS@@ S CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
IT IS DIS@@ GRACEFUL
THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN ME@@ ALS
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS AP@@ I@@ ECE AND THREE JO@@ INTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GIL@@ LS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OP@@ ENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LAR@@ VA@@ E
WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE N@@ Y@@ MP@@ H
OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BU@@ GS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGH@@ TEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JO@@ INTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PIN@@ C@@ ERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CAT@@ CHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGH@@ TEN@@ S THE JO@@ INT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PIN@@ C@@ ERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
SCARED DA@@ H WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHAL@@ LOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NA@@ P AFTER HIS DINNER
HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LAR@@ VA CRAW@@ LED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
THE N@@ Y@@ MPH@@ S HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
FER@@ DIN@@ AND MEDIT@@ ATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BUR@@ STS OF PROSPER@@ ITY AS IN DAR@@ KER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUN@@ ION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE
THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPE@@ CTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHEN@@ DED BY OUR FRIEND FER@@ DIN@@ AND AR@@ MINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MI@@ RA@@ BEL WHOSE SLU@@ MBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVER@@ IES IN WHICH WE BRO@@ OD OVER COMING BL@@ IS@@ S AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
FER@@ DIN@@ AND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
IT WAS INDEED HER HAND@@ WRITING
RESTLESS WITH IMP@@ ENDING JOY HE SA@@ UN@@ TERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LE@@ ANT OVER THE BAL@@ U@@ STRA@@ DE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHAR@@ MED AND CHARMING VAC@@ ANCY
HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS F@@ LIT@@ TED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHE@@ W THE CU@@ D
FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FOR@@ LOR@@ N OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE B@@ LESS@@ INGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHO@@ W@@ ERED AT HIS FEET
THE MOST GI@@ FTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND E@@ MUL@@ ATED EACH OTHER IN PRO@@ VING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
HE COULD NOT F@@ LATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MER@@ ITED SUCH SINGULAR B@@ LESS@@ INGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAUL@@ TS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FER@@ DIN@@ AND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HEN@@ RIE@@ TTA
HIS CONST@@ ANCY TO HER WAS NOW RE@@ WARDED
AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOL@@ CAN@@ O
AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN AB@@ STR@@ ACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
HE MIGHT BE ENCHAN@@ TED BUT THAT WAS THE TAL@@ IS@@ MAN
IN THE PRESENT UN@@ SETTLED THOUGH HO@@ PE@@ FUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FER@@ DIN@@ AND WOULD NOT GO HOME

IS PAPA ALONE EN@@ QUIRED MISS TEMPLE
GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HAR@@ DEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE
OUR BRI@@ GA@@ DE WAS FEAR@@ FULLY OUT@@ NU@@ MBERED
THERE WERE NO BREA@@ ST@@ WORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRI@@ GA@@ DE OF HA@@ MIL@@ TON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPUL@@ SED ASSA@@ ULT AFTER ASSA@@ ULT
NOT BAL@@ A@@ K@@ LA@@ VA NOR THE AL@@ MA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS A DU@@ EL TO THE DEATH
NO BAT@@ TERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
ONE DARING REBE@@ L WAS SHOT DOWN AND BA@@ YON@@ E@@ TED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
WITH A FEW LAN@@ TER@@ NS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
IT WAS NOT A QUESTION WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLAN@@ KET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING
HE SURVI@@ VED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANT@@ ATION IN MISSISSIPPI
WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO
THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HA@@ MIL@@ TON'S DIVISION TO ASSA@@ ULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLAN@@ K AT MIDNIGHT
UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTOR@@ IOUS REBE@@ L ARMY
ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BI@@ V@@ OU@@ AC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD T@@ IS@@ HIM@@ ING@@ O HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST
I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND
GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED
MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES
THE CLOUD OF REBEL@@ S WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKE@@ TRY TOO MO@@ WED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DO@@ ZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS
THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATT@@ LE@@ FIELD AMONG THE UN@@ BURIED DEAD
INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FI@@ LE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
ROSE@@ CRAN@@ S PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HAT@@ CHI@@ E BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVAL@@ RY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HO@@ GS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT
HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WIS@@ ER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EV@@ ILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU
WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NE@@ AR@@ BY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHAN@@ T'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT
LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHAN@@ T'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATT@@ LED THE TI@@ LES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TOR@@ RENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OP@@ POSE IT
BU@@ I WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR
IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DES@@ SER@@ T AND HAD SPR@@ INKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIR@@ WAY AND UN@@ BOL@@ T THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEF@@ TAIN
PERHAPS YOU CAN OUTW@@ IT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
THE MERCHAN@@ T'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM
YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR
THE CRIES AND CUR@@ SES OF THE RO@@ BB@@ ERS FILLED THE AIR
THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
ALL MY WOR@@ RIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
OH YOU SIMP@@ LETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PL@@ ANE THE CO@@ FF@@ INS FOR US
BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UN@@ BAR@@ RING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
AH FATHER SAID HAN@@ SEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
BUT IN REALITY HAN@@ SEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PE@@ BBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRU@@ ST WITH THE CHILDREN
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEP@@ MOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLI@@ CE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HE@@ W WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
HAN@@ SEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRE@@ THEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND P@@ ANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONT@@ ENT@@ EDLY
COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WIT@@ CH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREAD@@ HOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTI@@ CE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COO@@ KED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTI@@ VAL OF THE DAY
THEN SHE TOOK UP HAN@@ SEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LAT@@ TI@@ CE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCRE@@ AMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
GRE@@ THEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WIT@@ CH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
GRE@@ THEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HAN@@ SEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED
CREEP IN SAID THE WIT@@ CH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRE@@ THEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE O@@ VEN AND LET HER BA@@ KE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HAN@@ SEL
SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE O@@ VEN
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WIT@@ CH@@ 'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CAS@@ KETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BEN@@ N@@ Y@@ DECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RAN@@ DAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SY@@ DNE@@ Y'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRU@@ ISE WAS OVER
THIS ALTER@@ NATIVE IN THE CAP@@ TAIN'S PLANS TERMIN@@ ATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMP@@ LATED PUZZLED RAN@@ DAL
RAN@@ DAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BEN@@ N@@ Y@@ DECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SY@@ DEN@@ HAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGRE@@ ES WITH HIM
HAD HER BEAUTY FASCIN@@ ATED HIM
RAN@@ DAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMIN@@ ING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIV@@ ATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
HE DRANK THE WINE GREE@@ DILY
WHATEVER REVI@@ VING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
RAN@@ DAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SY@@ D@@ NEY IS
I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NIC@@ ELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVER@@ NESS
I'M AFRAID HE SAID
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRA@@ INS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FE@@ VERED HEAD
WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
YOU CAN'T DO IT
LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MOR@@ VEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RAN@@ DAL AFTER THE BREAK@@ UP OF THE FAMILY
ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RAN@@ DAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SY@@ DEN@@ HAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEE@@ KLY JOUR@@ NAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RAN@@ DAL BOUGHT IT
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHI@@ ONABLE INTELLIGENCE
RAN@@ DAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PAR@@ AG@@ RA@@ PH
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADI@@ CTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTIN@@ ATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
MISSUS NOR@@ MAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
MISSUS PRE@@ STY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL
HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN
SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICI@@ OUSLY
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SY@@ DEN@@ HAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS
THE REPORT IS PRE@@ MATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW
SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRE@@ STY
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIV@@ OR@@ CED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRAND@@ CHILD WERE TREATED AT SAN@@ DY@@ SEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER P@@ INING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER
HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NOR@@ MAN AND TO MISSUS NOR@@ MAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHAR@@ MED WITH HIM
WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KIT@@ TY THAT MISSUS NOR@@ MAN WAS A WIDOW
WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
HONESTLY
AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KIT@@ TY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN
SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRE@@ STY YOUR DEF@@ ENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
RAN@@ DAL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE
A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BEN@@ N@@ Y@@ DECK
NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST NOW
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RAN@@ DAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHER@@ INE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BEN@@ N@@ Y@@ DECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
GOOD BY DEAR RAN@@ DAL
ARRIVED AT THE STATION RAN@@ DAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUB@@ LY DISTRE@@ SSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SY@@ D@@ NEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE
WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREE@@ DY PUBLIC APPETITE DEV@@ OURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE ED@@ ITOR CAN SUPPLY
SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRE@@ STY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSE@@ HOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KIT@@ T@@ Y'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN IN@@ SUPER@@ ABLE OBST@@ ACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSU@@ ADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SY@@ D@@ NEY AN INTERVIEW
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESS@@ FULLY CONFI@@ DING HER TO BEN@@ N@@ Y@@ DE@@ CK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RAN@@ D@@ AL'S VISIT TO SY@@ DEN@@ HAM
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RAN@@ DAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FOR@@ BID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
WHAT HAPP@@ IER FUTURE COULD AWA@@ IT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RAN@@ D@@ AL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CAN@@ DID AND TRU@@ THFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
HE ADDED SY@@ DNE@@ Y'S ADDRESS IN A POST@@ SCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCU@@ SA@@ BLE TO IN@@ FER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAP@@ TAIN'S PRO@@ POS@@ ALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHER@@ INE'S REPLY
GO DO YOU HEAR
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIR@@ CASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENT@@ RED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOO@@ D@@ SHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SW@@ ELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMP@@ LES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPI@@ LE@@ P@@ SY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTER@@ ANCE OF A CRY
AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PO@@ RES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE
D'@@ AV@@ RI@@ GN@@ Y RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM IN@@ HALE A POWERFUL RESTOR@@ ATIVE
D'@@ AV@@ RI@@ GN@@ Y UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAG@@ NE@@ TISM WHICH DRA@@ WS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOUR@@ N EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SO@@ BS EXCLA@@ MATIONS AND PRAYERS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR
OH YOU RA@@ VE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAV@@ ORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RA@@ VE
DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASS@@ IN ASKED MOR@@ REL
NO@@ IR@@ TIER LOOKED UPON MOR@@ REL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VAL@@ ENT@@ INE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
SAID MOR@@ REL SADLY YES REPLIED NO@@ IR@@ TIER
THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR
ASKED MOR@@ REL YES
MUST I LEAVE ALONE NO
BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES
GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CUL@@ PR@@ IT'S NAME MY FATHER THIR@@ STS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CON@@ JU@@ RES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
MOR@@ REL SUFFERED AN EXCLA@@ MATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AF@@ FIRM@@ ATIVE
IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NO@@ IR@@ TIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS
BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
NO@@ IR@@ TIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UN@@ CLOSED THE LIPS
THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN AB@@ BE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS
D'@@ AV@@ RI@@ GN@@ Y SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I BESEE@@ CH YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLI@@ GE ME BY INTRODU@@ CING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT
I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FER@@ V@@ ENT THAN MINE
BUT WITH FULL RA@@ V@@ ISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHY@@ MES
ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LI@@ MP@@ ID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
THOU MA@@ KEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PRO@@ SERP@@ INA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LI@@ DS OF VENUS WHEN TRANS@@ FIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
YE ARE NEW COM@@ ERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PER@@ ADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELE@@ CT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVEL@@ LING BUT THE P@@ SAL@@ M D@@ ELE@@ C@@ TAST@@ I GI@@ VE@@ TH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UN@@ CLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGH@@ TING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOO@@ DLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HAN@@ SEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
BY HIS DE@@ FAULT SHORT WHILE HE SO@@ JOUR@@ NED HERE BY HIS DE@@ FAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
THIS EVERY OTHER SAV@@ OUR DOTH TRAN@@ SC@@ END AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLA@@ KED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVE@@ AL TO THEE NO MORE
BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MAR@@ G@@ INS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
NOW HEL@@ IC@@ ON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHO@@ IR UR@@ ANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SE@@ D@@ ATELY THEY HAD BEEN DIST@@ ANCED BY NEW WE@@ DDED BRI@@ DES
AND I BEHELD THE FLA@@ M@@ ELE@@ TS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DE@@ PIC@@ TED AND THEY OF TRA@@ ILING PENN@@ ONS HAD THE SE@@ MB@@ LANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SE@@ VEN@@ FOLD LI@@ STS ALL OF THEM OF THE COL@@ OURS WHENCE THE SUN@@ 'S BOW IS MADE AND DELI@@ A'S GIR@@ DLE
THESE STAN@@ DAR@@ DS TO THE RE@@ AR@@ WARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OU@@ TER@@ MOST APART
THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHAR@@ I@@ OT TRIUMP@@ HA@@ L ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRI@@ FF@@ IN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E@@ '@@ ER GLA@@ DD@@ ENED AFRI@@ CAN@@ US OR AUGU@@ ST@@ US BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
THREE MAID@@ ENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMER@@ ALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UN@@ LIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GA@@ IT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTER@@ DI@@ CTED
AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSI@@ ONED SINGING VEN@@ I SPON@@ S@@ A DE LI@@ BAN@@ O SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMO@@ TE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOY@@ HOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELI@@ ANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLI@@ CTED
TO SAY UNTO VIR@@ GI@@ LI@@ US NOT A DR@@ ACH@@ M OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
DAN@@ TE BECAUSE VIR@@ GI@@ LI@@ US HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET A@@ WHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED@@ '@@ ST MUST WEEP
I SAW THE LADY WHO ERE@@ WHILE APPEARED VE@@ ILED UNDERNEATH THE ANG@@ ELI@@ C FESTI@@ VAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
LOOK AT ME WELL IN SO@@ OTH I'M BE@@ AT@@ RICE
YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DO@@ LE BE OF ONE MEASURE
BUT BY THE LAR@@ GE@@ SS OF CELE@@ STI@@ AL GRAC@@ ES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAP@@ OURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPRO@@ ACHES NOT
AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APP@@ LI@@ ANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PER@@ DITION
CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEED@@ FUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO AS@@ P@@ IRE TO
AND WHAT ALLU@@ RE@@ MENTS OR WHAT V@@ ANT@@ AGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOUL@@ DST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
HE TRANS@@ LATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF POE@@ MS BY THE ITALI@@ ANS CONTEMPOR@@ ARY WITH DAN@@ TE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VER@@ SION OF THE WHOLE V@@ ITA NU@@ O@@ VA PRO@@ SE AND VERSE
THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF RO@@ S@@ SETT@@ I TO RANK AS A POE@@ TIC TRANS@@ LAT@@ OR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT
THE LIFE BLOOD OF RHYTH@@ MICAL TRANS@@ LATION IS THIS COMMAN@@ D@@ MENT THAT A GOOD PO@@ EM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO EN@@ DOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITER@@ ALITY OF REN@@ DERING IS ALTOGETHER SECON@@ DARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
OFTEN WOULD HE AVA@@ IL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDI@@ OM AND EPO@@ CH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CA@@ DENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR@@ 'S STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR@@ 'S CA@@ DENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF A STAN@@ ZA MUST BE WEA@@ KENED TO ADO@@ PT SOME RHY@@ ME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVEL@@ LING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SC@@ ANTI@@ LY SUPPLIED
AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANS@@ LATE THE ANALY@@ SES OF THE POE@@ MS WHICH I O@@ MITTED
ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY AND MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED
MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE OF RE@@ VIS@@ ING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PAL@@ TRY AND USELESS
IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF
THROUGHOUT THE V@@ ITA NU@@ O@@ VA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH RE@@ ACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PRE@@ PA@@ RES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DAN@@ TE'S AUTO@@ BIO@@ GRAPHY
THIS HAS INDUCED SOME ED@@ ITORS OF THE V@@ ITA NU@@ O@@ VA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
THEREAFTER THIS SON@@ NET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DI@@ VERS TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
BUT WHEN I STILL SPA@@ KE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LO@@ VE@@ ST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CAN@@ ST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BE@@ AT@@ ITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGH@@ S
AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHE@@ DS SUCH PERFECT SWEE@@ TNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LIST@@ EN@@ ERS MUST BE ALL RESI@@ GN@@ 'D
WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIER@@ CE TO THE HEAR@@ T'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
TO HER I W@@ END ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONC@@ ILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE
THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW
THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR
IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPE@@ DED BY FAIN@@ THE@@ AR@@ TE@@ DNESS
